<h2 id="hi-friends">Hi friends,</h2>

<p><img src="https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/7zk3ZR" alt="Daily Vibes Apple Store Screenshots" /></p>

<p>In a previous release of ‚≠êÔ∏è <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/id1332324033">Daily Vibes</a> üì≤, version 1.3.0, I added a natural language date parser. What this basically means that if you enter</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>appointment with my accountant tomorrow at 3 pm</p>
</blockquote>

<p>‚≠êÔ∏è <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/id1332324033">Daily Vibes</a> üì≤ will understand what you mean. This is all possible because of the wonderful work done on <a href="https://github.com/quire-io/SwiftyChrono">SwiftyChrono</a>. However, I shipped üö¢ it with some pending things that are needed to be taken care of with the library. Figured I would fix it later down the road since it seems to work as expected üòÖ</p>

<p>This week, I‚Äôve decided to tackle the issues and help updating <a href="https://github.com/quire-io/SwiftyChrono">SwiftyChrono</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/WQSc8k" alt="Github SwiftyChrono PR" /></p>

<p>Internally, SwiftyChrono uses <a href="https://github.com/quire-io/SwiftyChrono/tree/master/Tests/SwiftyChronoTests/JS/en">javascript</a> for testing. After the upgrades, I wanted to make sure that the tests work.</p>

<h2 id="javascript-core">JavaScript [Core]</h2>

<p>So, I began üëÄ looking for issues ‚õà</p>

<p>One of the issues was narrowed down to be in <a href="https://github.com/quire-io/SwiftyChrono/blob/55f7a642916c24637c8c22d656884c0681b3aa48/Tests/SwiftyChronoTests/JS/en/test_en.js#L1">this area of the code</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/9mAyJg" alt="Problem code image" /></p>

<p>If you notice, it is just javascript that is being executed. I know javascript so it should be no problem to debug, right?</p>

<p>Well, for starters, how do you debug javascript that is executed from Xcode? How does Xcode run javascript? This leads you down the rabbit hole to find that Apple has nicely introduced <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore">JavaScript Core</a> internally (<a href="nshipster.com/javascriptcore/">more info</a>).</p>

<h2 id="sothe-tldr">So‚Ä¶the tl;dr</h2>

<p>It is very easy. Apple has built a nice interaction between Xcode and Safari.</p>

<p>The credit for the following steps to this answer goes to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/43916256">Rakesh Yembaram</a> on stackoverflow.com</p>

<h3 id="1-open-safari-and-enable-developer-menu">1. Open Safari and Enable Developer Menu</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Open Safari</li>
  <li>Enable the Develop menu by going to:
    <ul>
      <li>‚ÄúPreferences‚Äù</li>
      <li>‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù</li>
      <li>‚ÄúShow Develop menu in menu bar‚Äù</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/mnewCo" alt="Show Develop Menu in Menu Bar of Safari" /></p>

<h3 id="2-enable-jscontext">2. Enable JSContext</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Go to Develop menu
<img src="https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/fGg3fS" alt="Develop menu in Safari" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find your simulator or computer agent and enable</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Automatically show web inspector for JSContexts</li>
      <li>Automatically pause connecting to JSContexts</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-re-run-project-in-xcode">3. Re-run project in Xcode</h3>

<p>For my example, I‚Äôm just going to simply add <code class="highlighter-rouge">debugger</code> keyword to the Javascript file</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/d5zfNe" alt="added debugger to source code" /></p>

<p>and then I press run on the tests
<img src="https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/lpBPFQ" alt="press run on Xcode test images" /></p>

<p>and I wait until Safari does its the magic:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/tLQhEf" alt="safari doing magic" /></p>

<p>There you go, hopefully now you can see that it is not that difficult to debug any javascript that your app might contain.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading and until next time my friend.</p>

<h2 id="apple-store">Apple Store</h2>

<p>I uploaded <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/id1332324033?mt=8&amp;at=1010lK7Y">Daily Vibes</a> to the Apple App Store simply because I wanted to have it out there rather than keep it under wraps. I figured I would add value to the software as I go. In retrospect, it was a good decision because it allowed me to find value quicker (as opposed to when I was working on the app under wraps).</p>

<p>After listening to some <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/show-ih-daily-vibes-ios-80a69b4368">feedback on IndieHackers</a> I decided to start working on ASO (Apple Store Optimization). Signed up for Apple‚Äôs Ads. Signed up for their Affiliate program. Started researching.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-have-learned-so-far">What I have learned so far:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Title matters</li>
  <li>Description matters</li>
  <li>Keywords matter</li>
  <li>Having screenshots ??? apparently matters</li>
  <li>Having a video ?? apparently matters</li>
  <li>Description and other stuff that you have to fill in‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt matter</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-else-i-have-learned">What else I have learned?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>What you actually put in any of those fields doesn‚Äôt really matter. Don‚Äôt get attached to your App name, App Description, Keywords or anything else to do with it. This is important for indie developers with no ad budget. Why? Because we want to be found so people use our software.</li>
  <li>If you have a budget then you can pick your Branding carefully and you can ignore what I said above</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, while working on improving Daily Vibes I am also looking at improving my overall marketing. I am going to do it iteratively and learn along the way.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="what-is-my-plan-of-attack">What is my plan of attack?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>improve title (Daily Vibes ‚û°Ô∏è Daily Vibes: Life Task Manager)</li>
  <li>improve subtitle (Todo List &amp; Life Day Organizer ‚û°Ô∏è To do list, life day organizer)</li>
  <li>improve keywords; currently haven‚Äôt decided:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>to-do, list app, list maker, task list, todo list, list, task, todo, to do, life organizer, daily</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>todo,list,organizer,tracker,task,project,things,productivity,to do,to-do,keep,reminder,day planner</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>life organizer, good vibes, daily tasks, daily office, daily calender,
daily lists, daily organizer, lists maker,</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>make screenshots localized with pretty text (via <a href="fastlane.tools">fastlane.tools</a>) ‚Ä¶ something like:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/LcaVFa+" alt="LocalizedScreenshot sample" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>make AND edit AND upload a video</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/cmP5EE+" alt="Video WIP Screenshot" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>improve aforementioned screenshots</li>
  <li>improve aforementioned video</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these ideas are up in the air while I am writing this post. I am hoping to ship them with next release, hopefully sometime next week. Then, I will have to wait and look at the analytics.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>A lot of work goes behind the scenes for a single app. I am beginning to appreciate indie developers and their successful products. You really need to be comfortable with wearing ALL of the hats that make a successful business.</p>

<p>For me, marketing is an uncharted area and I was hesitant to start learning it. But look at me now, I can make icons, promo videos, and start being strategic about growth. It is a journey that I am enjoying but it is challenging.</p>

<p>I also paved the road and did all of the necessary paper work to add in app subscriptions. Now I just gotta figure out my strategy in this area ;)</p>

<p>Oh and in closing news, I wanted to keep to a somewhat relaxed 2 week shipping cycle‚Ä¶ and so far I have been sticking to the schedule of regular updates =) I hope I can keep this up!</p>

<p>Thank you for reading and until next time my friend.</p>

        <p>Happy Friday üëã</p>

<p>It is so easy to let this writing to get out of hand even though I promised to write more regularly. I‚Äôve been chugging along with a lot of things since last update.</p>

<p><em>I am still have trouble understanding how to use TestFlight</em>. I have done quite a bit of work over the past few days and I wanted to release it to the beta testers. However, I am currently stuck in this state:</p>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/7jVbKS/Vve27WMfts+" alt="Stuck on these TestFlights" /></p>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/Ade4Dd/XZMSnuzKCa+" alt="TestFlight Stuck on Ready to Submit Screen" /></p>

<p>Basically I am stuck just like this person that wrote <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/44716499">TestFlight build on iTunes Connect stuck at ‚ÄòReady to Submit‚Äô</a>. I‚Äôve contacted some fellow iOS developers and am now doing what they suggested.</p>

<p>What did I learn from them?</p>
<ul>
  <li>every new application version gets a review that you need to go through (which is exactly what is happening now from what I understand). I like <a href="https://semver.org">semver</a>, so technically this would be a <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.2</code> version. It has been primarily bug fixes and UI changes.</li>
  <li>every new build, under a reviewed version, does not have to go through this process (apparently). So, this is what I am currently trying:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/8G17N9/9OFVGZcfuV+" alt="Trying to make the app live" /></p>

<p>While, I am waiting for that to go through, I want to debug and figure out what is wrong with <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.2</code>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: After writing the original text, the solution did not work. Not sure what I am missing but here is what I‚Äôve done:</p>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/oztmDY/7rYtV1OYGc+" alt="TestFlight process" /></p>

<p>Also, it also seems that information from bullet point #2 is funky. I changed the app back to <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.1</code> and changed build to <code class="highlighter-rouge">2</code> and, as you can see, the app is still in the ‚ÄúReady for Submit‚Äù state.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm going to continue with this and, in mean time, I think I am just going to contact Apple Support.</p>

<hr />

<p>PS. Yes, I did consult <a href="https://help.apple.com/itunes-connect/developer/#/dev78d0a8f87">View build status and metrics page</a> and <a href="https://help.apple.com/itunes-connect/developer/#/dev3d6869aff">app build statuses page</a>.</p>

<p>I wish Apple would provide more information on this ‚ÄúReady to Submit‚Äù state because this does not really help me at this point in the process ü§ï Why? Because by clicking on this link:</p>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/Dy4n8t/zHHV2KGmdt+" alt="Click on this link" /></p>

<p>Will bring me to:</p>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/i0YRH9/sAGc3S3smm+" alt="Ready to Submit definition from Apple" /></p>

<p>Which doesn‚Äôt really answer how to submit ü§ï</p>

<p>So, Daily Vibes is stuck somewhere here:</p>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/W9e1HV/LS8BkWOfsq+" alt="Daily Vibes is stuck in one of these phases" /></p>

<p>Cheers,
Alex</p>

<p>This will be a quick post, mainly a reference to some resource I‚Äôve been using to get familiar with iOS testing and refactoring.</p>

<p>Refactoring is fun because I get to exercise my software engineering muscles. This is one of the reasons that I like Swift so much. I get to apply my software engineering knowledge on my own projects üëè</p>

<p>Testing on the whole is not difficult in iOS. However, when you add things like CoreData then it becomes a bit more chaotic to filter through.</p>
