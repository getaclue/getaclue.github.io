      It is fun to be creating in the programming language that is trending. Ruby on Rails was trending among the software craftsperson community throughout the 2010s and in the late 2000s. And I say ruby on rails not ruby. Personally, I do not happen to care very much for Ruby. It looks the same as Python and even is written using similar syntax and notation. However, it just so happens that ruby on rails was built using Ruby. It provided quick way to create projects while being the talk of everyone. The most productive framework if you may. Part of the fun was that everyone was creating using it. As a result, you could find people using ruby on rails in many places and you feel a sense of community without being in one. Among the fun experience, ruby on...

      If you are not producing projects, writing, or contributing socially and you are a software person, are you growing? I have been experiencing a bit of FOMO. You see, last year I kind of went on a social diet of sorts and reduced my presence on social platforms. One of the negative outcomes of this, is my lack of output during this time. Now you see, I have had output at work but that does not satisfy me. I don’t have a thing that I can show or talk about that is interesting on average. It seems that in this software craftperson field, you need to be methodical about your work plus document it. Plus… plus… you need to showcase it somehow. A portfolio is kind of a must in our software field. At least for now, since I don’t...

      Some updates since last post on December 2018 not using fastmail – I currently paused on using fastmail for a more affordable namecheap email alternative. It works just fine for now. Took a pause – last year was intense and required me to take a pause. I had a lot of personal issues last year that took time away from all of my previously enjoyed side projects. Thus, I had to put most of them on pause. Taking a pause really threw a wrench in my motivation and my previous velocity. Elderoost - also happens that someone purchased elderoost.com as I paused on the project. Very weird; oh well. All of the data and the actual project is offline. The project currently is currently on pause as I learn django. Goal is to re-write the project using Python. Daily Vibes...
