      <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>I just ran into <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/sepp/ICME-13.Epp.pdf">‚ÄúDiscrete Mathematics For Computer Science‚Äù</a> by Susanna S. Epp (13th International Congress on Mathematical Education Hamburg, 24-31 July 2016). The piece resonated with me and I decided to note some reflections from my own experience down.</p>

<p><strong>I added my own emphasis to the quotes below.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúThe material in discrete structures is pervasive in the areas of data structures and algorithms but <strong>appears elsewhere</strong> in computer science as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement resonates very well with me. During my education, there was a big emphasis on data structures and importance of maths in <em>that</em> field. However, there was almost no time spent on the <em>appears elsewhere</em> part of my studies. This left me frustrated lots of times primarily because I went into software engineering to learn about the application of theory.</p>

<p>It is also how I know about Susanna S. Epp and her book <em>Discrete Mathematics with Applications by Susanna S. Epp</em>. When I found my education exposure was lacking, I started to search for different strategies to learn difficult material. It turns out, if you add a little bit of effort, then you can find an author in your field of interest that can help you learn this challenging material. An author that writes in a way that you can understand.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is one thing that nobody talks about when you are having a difficult time understanding. The fact that if you are having a hard time studying, then a different solution or approach is needed for you</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you know that other approaches exist</li>
  <li>if you look hard for it</li>
  <li>if you take an initiative to self-study</li>
  <li>and self-research.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>[‚Ä¶] an ability to create and understand a proof ‚Äî either a formal symbolic proof or a less formal but still mathematically rigorous argument‚Äîis important in virtually every area of computer science, including (to name just a few) formal specification, verification, databases, and cryptography.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[g]raph theory concepts are used in networks, operating systems, and compilers.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Set theory concepts are used in software engineering and in databases.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Probability theory is used in intelligent systems, networking, and a number of computing applications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And while I do understand the reference points and examples ‚Äî I only do so because I went through the system. Looking backwards, when I was learning at the beginning, I recall a big emphasis on data structures and graphs. However, there was no justification besides rote memorization and <strong>needing it for this degree</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This paper explores three reasons for the problem. One is that there has been a reduced emphasis on mathematical proof in the secondary mathematics curriculum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anecdotally that was true in my experience. This subject matter was never fully conveyed to me - how proofs form the building blocks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A study of teacher attitudes by Knuth (2002) indicated that the teachers ‚Äúviewed proof as appropriate for the mathematics education of a minority of students‚Äù and that they saw proof ‚Äúas a <strong>topic of study</strong> rather than as a <strong>tool for communicating and studying mathematics</strong>.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeap‚Ä¶ ding ding ding. That‚Äôs how it was conveyed to me in Canadian school system as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A second is that the <strong>ways certain words and phrases</strong> are interpreted <strong>in ordinary speech</strong> often differ from the ways they must be interpreted in formal, deductive reasoning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I cannot tell you how much I struggled with this. The cognitive collusion between ordinary speech and formal reasoning. It is tough to get your head around the complicated subject matter. It really is.</p>

<p>And these things follow you if you do not grasp them when first learning. As someone who had no English vocabulary, I was studying the new language in parallel as I was getting my education foundation and going through the education system. Not only does it make studying these concepts confusing, it also makes the entire field of Maths as some type of mountain that you cannot climb.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of my time memorizing content without understanding. While this approach works to some degree, it almost always fails as you get higher up the knowledge ladder.</p>

<p>What I did not realize, at the time that I was struggling, was that the road blocks should have signaled to me that I had foundational issues. Instead, I plowed forward without having the full picture.</p>

<p>I understand this now and it is part of the reason why I read up on things like this in my free time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of their tasks as students is to learn how to extract the standard interpretation from what is said and written. One of the tasks of instructors is to teach them how to do that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>100% did not experience this. In all of my experience so far the instructors believed in rote replication via writing. While this may work for some learning styles, it really did not work for me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One example is that in everyday speech if-then is frequently interpreted as if-and-only-if.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did I find this confusing? Check.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only-if is also routinely interpreted as if-and-only-if.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did I find this confusing? Check.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In propositional logic the negation of ‚Äúif A then B‚Äù is the conjunction ‚ÄúA and not B,‚Äù ‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did I find this confusing? Check.</p>

<p>It is a bit hard to reflect on this now because I am much more familiar with this subject. But I will try to step back and play around with my thoughts. The author mentions that students seem to reply <code class="highlighter-rouge">if A then not B</code> as the common solution to the negation.</p>

<p>While I can justify that response in my head, my brain wants to say <code class="highlighter-rouge">if not A then not B</code> but it definitely doesn‚Äôt think <code class="highlighter-rouge">not A or B</code> nor <code class="highlighter-rouge">not A and B</code>. Sure, I know the theory and I know about truth tables. And, if I force myself then I can definitely come up to the solution.</p>

<p>However, what I am saying is that it is still challenging to think about these things when you have mental clashes with your everyday speech.</p>

<p>See:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For instance, a natural response to ‚ÄúIf John comes, then the party will be a disaster‚Äù is ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. If John comes, then the party will not be a disaster. It will be fine.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This takes the language issue a bit further:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to the rules of predicate logic, when a statement contains <strong>two different quantifiers</strong>, they should be interpreted in <strong>left-right order</strong>. However in ordinary language a statement with both for-all and there-is is typically interpreted in <strong>whatever way makes the most common sense</strong>. Linguists call this ‚Äúscope ambiguity.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, the most natural way to interpret the sentence, ‚ÄúThere is a lid for every pot‚Äù is as ‚ÄúFor every pot there is a lid‚Äù not as ‚ÄúThere is one single lid that will be fit every pot.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think about this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A third is the difficulties students experience in understanding and using statements involving variables, both in connection with predicate logic and in interpreting certain kinds of mathematical phrases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very true but to me, this stems from issue created in #2 regarding language.</p>

<p>I liked the following examples provided in the piece:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What we say ‚Äî What we mean
    <ul>
      <li>the value of x ‚Äî the quantity that is put in place of
x</li>
      <li>as the value of x increases ‚Äî as larger and larger numbers are put in place of x</li>
      <li>As the value of x increases, the value of y increases. ‚Äî If larger and larger numbers are put in place of x, the corresponding numbers that are put in place of y become larger and larger
.</li>
      <li>where x is any real number ‚Äî for all possible substitutions of real numbers in place of x</li>
      <li>Let n be any even number ‚Äî Imagine substituting an integer in place of n but <strong>do not assume anything about its value</strong> except that it is an even integer
.</li>
      <li>By definition of even, <code class="highlighter-rouge">n = 2k</code> for some integer <code class="highlighter-rouge">k</code> ‚Äî By definition of even, there is an integer we can substitude in place of <code class="highlighter-rouge">k</code> so that the equation <code class="highlighter-rouge">n = 2k</code> will be true. (In fact, there is only one such integer; its value is <code class="highlighter-rouge">n/2</code>)</li>
      <li>the function <code class="highlighter-rouge">x^2</code> ‚Äî the function that relates each real number to the square of that number. In other words, for each possible substitution of a real number in place of <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code>, the function corresponds to the square of that number.</li>
      <li>where <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> is some real number that satisfies the given property ‚Äî There is a real number that will make the given property true if we substitude it in place of x.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>While I respect the author and the work she does, it appears that math education is a loosing battle. I skimmed through author‚Äôs article from 1987 (The Logic of Teaching Calculus. In Toward a Lean and Lively Calculus: Report of the Conference Workshop to Develop Curriculum and Teaching Methods for Calculus at the College Level. Ronald G. Douglas, Ed. Washington, D.C.: Mathematical Association of America, 1987, 41-59.) where she outlined similar concerns around logic (only that time it was in the context of calculus).</p>

<p>It has been more than 30 years and it appears that new students are continuing to struggle with maths. Anecdotally, I hear concerned systems and parents pushing for programming skills while pushing away core maths. If you found math challenging or confusing I encourage you not to give up. You can study it on your own.</p>

<p>Start your studies wherever you got confused. There are tests available that can help you narrow it down. Start from grade 1 if you want to. Who is going to judge? Open up khan academy and go to town. Discover the beauty and study on your own time‚Ä¶ I did (and I still am).</p>

<p>If it wasn‚Äôt for Khan Academy, self-studying, youtube, and the people of the internet in general ‚Äî I am not sure if I would be where I am.</p>

        <p>Those of you that know me personally, know that I do a lot of little experiments and I like to reflect. I believe in engineering and science principles. They are at my core and drive me forward.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I feel like I am not doing a good job in reflecting and sharing that with you. What happens usually is that I open up a blank canvas, such as this one, and just start writing. Usually I have a topic or a direction that motivates me to write. However, I do not consider if I will publish or delete the content at the time of writing it.</p>

<p>This is what I mean by a blank canvas in September 2018:
<img src="/assets/images/2018-09-28/Screen-Shot-2018-09-29-at-12.12.33.png" alt="Blank canvas" /></p>

<p>As a result, I have a lot of written content spread out across various computers, domains, and publications. A lot of this content is not published and, if taken out of context, may seem like a waste of my time. Personally, I find it very difficult to hit that publish button for many reasons.</p>

<p>To me, writing is cathartic in a sense ‚Äî the single purpose is to remove the content from my head. When the ideas are out of my head and on a canvas then I can play with them. In my head there is chaos, so I like to consolidate my ideas and to make sense of them. To tease out my views and opinions (and to correct them).</p>

<p>If you take this into consideration, then perhaps you can see why some of my pieces don‚Äôt get my approval and thus never see the light. However, the longer I live on this earth, the more I wish I didn‚Äôt hold back and just publish (whether or not it is finished). So, I decided to actively work on this.</p>

<p>One of my goals for 2018 was to publish more frequent written updates. The intention was not only to improve the quality of my written content but also to documenting a process.</p>

<p><em>It is the end of September. Month #9 is almost done. So how have I been doing?</em></p>

<p>On the whole, I have been doing way better than any of my previous years. If you take a look at this year alone, I have published 11 pieces of work so far. Some of them even required a lot of additional work. Gasp!!! One thing for sure ‚Äî I have been staying consistent. Whatever that means to me.</p>

<p>If I take a look at it this way, then my progress is happening. I am growing and developing. However, during my day-to-day thinking it feels more negative. I feel like I could be doing better in this area. I still find myself falling into the trap of not publishing. Reflecting on this progress definitely helps to stay on track.</p>

<p>So, I think I am doing OK even if it doesn‚Äôt feel like that. I give myself the permission to make mistakes, publish more frequent and unfinished work; and continue this journey that I started.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened-since-the-last-post">What happened since the last <a href="/blog/i-have-to-come-clean-about-my-project">post</a>?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>in June/July/August, I finished the backend &amp; frontend MVP for dailyvibes
    <ul>
      <li>the said backend and frontend are not live yet to anyone but you may see some things <a href="https://github.com/dailyvibes">here</a></li>
      <li>PS, as an aside ‚Äî I am considering migrating away from github to self-hosted for all of my work</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>in July, worked on <a href="https://screenhole.net/">screenhole</a> and created an MVP for a Mac OS screen recorder functionality. That was a fun experiment that you can view at <a href="https://screenhole.net/getaclue/~g8U2vv">https://screenhole.net/getaclue/~g8U2vv</a> Unfortunately that is not a public feature and is stuck in alpha/beta stage until further notice.</li>
  <li>in July/August, worked on <a href="https://keyframes.net/">keyframes</a> native Mac app. Was a bit of work but looks nice in my opinion. This work is in <a href="https://keyframes.net/snapper/beta">beta</a> and is available for download.</li>
  <li>in August, launched our <a href="https://cspray.ca/">physical product</a> at the <a href="https://theex.com/">Canadian National Exhibition</a>. That was intense. Will talk about this more at a later time ;-) but lets just say we are continuing working on this project. This was a FIRST for us and also a BIG deal!!!
    <ul>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Attendance: 1.54 million (2016)</code> ‚Äî may hint to you at why. And we made sure to talk to almost everyone that passed by us. I say almost because it was just the two of us.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>in September, started to work on news article parser for <a href="https://elderoost.com/">elderoost</a>. One of the current challenges is keeping up to news. I physically read all of the articles manually and filter them manually. This honestly takes a lot of time. If you check the website the latest article was added <code class="highlighter-rouge">5 months ago</code>. I have all of the articles since then I just haven‚Äôt processed them yet.
    <ul>
      <li>current working approach:
        <ul>
          <li>get news article link</li>
          <li>go to the link</li>
          <li>grab the URL, title, headline, author, date of publication, and the content
            <ul>
              <li>I found a script that helps with grabbing all of this (similar to how some browsers allow you to have a read an html page in plain text if you click a button)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>put this stuff into postgres db</li>
          <li>index title and content using elasticsearch</li>
          <li>for each residence search against this text</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>unfortunately it is not done as I cannot narrow down some edge cases.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="and-what-am-i-up-to-now">and what am I up to now?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>job search
    <ul>
      <li>After 2 years and some, I think it is time as there aren‚Äôt any new opportunities for growth as a software engineer where I am</li>
      <li>The work moved to a new physical location that is more challenging to commute to</li>
      <li>My school debt is causing me a lot of stress and anxiety‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôd like to pay this off faster.</li>
      <li>I am not being paid what I know I could be for someone with my needed skills
        <ul>
          <li>I stayed because of the team but that recently got dissolved</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>cspray</li>
  <li>dailyvibes
    <ul>
      <li>add user auth functionality on ios
        <ul>
          <li>make user auth functionality work between ios and server</li>
          <li>make a sync mechanism between ios and server (probably manual for now and then automate)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>modify the way you share links within iOS (add a new area so it is easier to share)
        <ul>
          <li>share these links from iOS to server (after the user stuff is linked up)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>provision a server on DO or Linode
        <ul>
          <li>glue the backend &amp; frontend on this server</li>
          <li>glue the server to dailyvibes domain</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>elderoost
    <ul>
      <li>finish news article parser</li>
      <li>add a notifyer after this is done to manually review</li>
      <li>figure out monetization</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>‚Ä¶ in that order I think.</p>

<p>Now, I‚Äôm going to spend the next little while grinding cracking the coding interview bible and all of the typical hackerrank websites. It is a bit unfortunate that I need to put a pause on the side projects to do this. But it is what it is. (Especially if you want to work for the typical Fortune N company.)</p>

<hr />

<p>And for those of you that finished reading this, here is some behind the scenes context to this article. It is an example of a written piece that I ended up <a href="/blog/would-you-let-your-mother-use-your-software">publishing</a>. It started off as a <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway app</a> draft and then, eventually, I approved and transformed it into an article.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 30px" class="side-projects-note">
  <small>Unless otherwise mentioned in the post, those projects are side projects which I work on on weekends and evenings, and are not affiliated with my work or employer.</small>

        <p>I have something to tell you and come clean about. I haven‚Äôt touched my beloved dailyvibes code base since April. And if I am being completely honest, I kind of lost steam in March. (To give you some context, I started thinking about the project in October and working on it last November. Since November I tried to ship something every 2 weeks.)</p>

<p>Everything was fine until about March. In March, I felt that I did not like where I was going, I was having a bad time, and I was losing project‚Äôs direction. I even had thoughts of abandoning it.</p>

<p>I also knew that my app was stable enough for people to use. Thus, if I was about to abandon my work then at least people would not lose their data. These thoughts allowed me to slow down and to reflect. Afterall, I still care about the project.</p>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/klf5jH+" alt="you're going to have a bad time image" /></p>

<p>Whenever I start thinking this way about a project, I become aware that it is a good time to step back and reflect. In other words, it is a good time to see if my time is worth investing into a project.</p>

<p>To start, I wanted to figure out what was causing me to feel this way. I narrowed it down to the following three issues:</p>

<h2 id="1-i-was-facing-technical-issues">1. I was facing technical issues.</h2>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/ai0zYr+" alt="subject to technical issues - free image from https://pixabay.com/en/problem-technical-issues-technology-1951987/" /></p>

<p>As I work solo, I did not want to spend my limited time on things that do not move the project forward (in the users eyes). But, it got to a point where I needed to <a href="https://www.briantracy.com/blog/time-management/the-truth-about-frogs/">eat that frog</a>. It is one of the challenges that comes with indie work. You wear many hats. You are playing the role of a product manager and have to decide on what to work on. Sometimes you have to do the work that you do not want to.</p>

<h2 id="2-i-was-not-happy-with-the-direction-of-the-project">2. I was not happy with the direction of the project.</h2>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/DMndPx+" alt="lost found searching - image from https://pixabay.com/en/lost-found-lost-and-found-searching-1605501/" /></p>

<p>At the beginning of the project, I needed to do some market research. I needed to check if this project was worth my interest and time. How did I do my market research? Well, it was very simple. I downloaded all the productivity / todo apps from the Apple App Store and I played with each one of them. I noted down ideas that I liked and things that I did not like. But, by doing that, my phone looks like this now:</p>

<p><a href="https://d.pr/v/CtydOz"><img src="https://d.pr/i/b8PU7m+" alt="my ios screen" /></a></p>

<p>After playing with each app, I‚Äôve come to realize that most of the apps do the same thing.</p>

<p>What this means to the users is that they have a lot of choice in this saturated category of productivity. In otherwords, they can switch from my product much easier.</p>

<p>What this means to me is that I don‚Äôt need to stress on competing. I was aligning dailyvibes with other similar apps. This process made me bored and stopped using the app. Dailyvibes started because I was not happy of the solutions. Instead I will focus on building features that will be useful to the end user and to me. I will focus on the product and its quality.</p>

<p>So I took a step back and recorded the actions that I do every day. I interact with the following data structures: tasks to complete today, notes/text snippets, links/bookmarks, gifs / images and photos. One thing that kind of doesn‚Äôt fit is positive thoughts / quotes. I need to think some on this.</p>

<p>So I will work on integrating these things into dailyvibes and thus forcing me to dogfood my own app. What will make all these things work together is some kind of linking mechanism. I will definitely polish this as time moves on.</p>

<p>After all, users have so much choice.</p>

<h2 id="3-i-did-not-know-what-direction-apple-will-take-mac-os-apps-in">3. I did not know what direction Apple will take Mac OS apps in.</h2>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/LE7TsI+" alt="marzipan rumours" /></p>

<p>The next biggest feature for dailyvibes is to create a server component. Which will be then followed by a syncing mechanism of some sort between the server and iOS app. Both of these components, would position me well to create either a a desktop companion app or a web app. I chose to wait until June to make this decision because of WWDC.</p>

<p>I could not decide if I wanted to leverage the iCloud ecosystem and have apple do all the legwork or me. I‚Äôve investigated both options. I decided to roll out my own for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I know how,</li>
  <li>I want to practice for my personal project, and</li>
  <li>I want to have control over my data.</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope that these decisions will also benefit the users.</p>

<p>I also could not decide if I wanted to spend time on a native Mac desktop app or on a web app. I am familiar with web but I am very new to the Mac. I investigated both options. I am deciding, at least for now, to focus on the web app component because I am more familiar with that. Plus, Apple admitted that there will be changes to Mac OS next year. I‚Äôll revisit native Mac app next year.</p>

<hr />

<p>It is nice to step back and reflect on how far you‚Äôve come with a project. It is good to be mindful. Albeit, I will be first to admit that it is challenging to talk about your project when it is not going as you expect. I am, once again excited, to keep working on the project and I have a better vision moving forward.</p>

<p>This is a nice feeling when you are happy with your decisions. Also, the organic discovery isn‚Äôt that bad either:</p>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/MLstRV+" alt="Q1 results" />
<img src="https://d.pr/i/dHUliO+" alt="Q2 results" /></p>

<p>If you‚Äôre making something, you have to be the first to believe in success of your thing. Do one thing every day that moves the project forward. Everything else will [hopefully] work itself out.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and until next time,</p>

<p>Alex</p>

        <p>Would you let your mother use your software?</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/V8kt2K" alt="Oh and I am not trying to single anyone out in this photo btw" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How about your father? sister? brother? wife? husband? fianc√©? grandparents? neighbour?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I can immediate hear some of you say:</p>

<ul>
  <li>But Alex ‚Ä¶ you would say ‚Ä¶</li>
  <li>‚Ä¶ they would never <em>use</em> my software‚Ä¶ they are not my <em>target audience</em></li>
  <li>Or‚Ä¶ I would teach them how to use my software properly.</li>
  <li>Or‚Ä¶ I would never let them use it.</li>
</ul>

<p>To <em>you</em>, my dear friend, I would ask that you play along with me in this exercise.</p>

<p>Suppose that the use of your software became mandatory. Suppose your friend or family member had no help or training from you. Suppose they were that user number #1110101 that you did not want to deal with. Take your pick.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are you following along?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are following, at what I am trying to say here, then I hope you can answer yes to my original question with some degree of confidence.</p>

<p>And no‚Ä¶ you cannot use the typical engineering answer of ‚Äúit depends‚Äù. Sorry, I want a binary response here: yes or no.</p>

<p>So, if your answer is a no then I hope that you might start thinking about these important issues. For example, you could start thinking about why are you leaning towards no? Perhaps, what can you do today to increase your level of confidence? Because you can.</p>

<p>Do you call yourself a scientist or an engineer? Do you have some variation of this title? Are you proud to call yourself that? Does it define who you are on a day-to-day basis? If so then you must think about ethics. It is your duty.</p>

<p>But maybe this belief is naive? Maybe this is not how it works in the real world? Maybe being associated with those things is not enough for such heavy consideration? Maybe we should leave ethics to someone else? We make software to solve some problem and that‚Äôs that.</p>

<p>Too often I see the answer that it is not applicable to me or my work. Too often I see ambivalence and lack of professional care. To me, this cannot be the winning formula moving forward.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôve been following software development for the past few years, then you‚Äôve noticed a certain trend by now. A trend of malpractice if you will. Followed by a trend of acceptance or standardization towards such malpractice. And if you dig a little deeper into these trends‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey are often, but not always, connected to some lapse in ethics.</p>

<p>And if you‚Äôre of the mind that ethics and business [and software] cannot mix‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI call for you to reconsider and have a conversation. I hope the pressure of shareholders and funding money does not blind your mission or your vision. Try to figure it out.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Just because you can do something, should you?</li>
  <li>If you should, then how can you do so while being ethical?</li>
  <li>If you cannot remain ethical, then the least you can do is own it. Don‚Äôt deny it. You are a professional, aren‚Äôt you?</li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps our approach to ethics needs a pivot?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maybe ethics, as a field, is too broad of a topic? Too abstract and not applicable?</li>
  <li>Maybe, it is time to reframe our delivery on ethics?</li>
  <li>Time to step back and reduce the scope so that we can understand better?</li>
</ul>

<p>So here is me‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätrying to do that for you. Next time you are working on software just give it a shot and ask yourself this relatable question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>would you let your <strong>_</strong> use your software?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôll let you fill in the blank. Don‚Äôt be lazy and do make it relatable.</p>

<p>Think about it because your answer should be yes with some level of confidence. It is 2018 and I am trying to take a gradual approach to this topic.</p>

<p>We are use a lot of software every single day.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And guess what?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is only the beginning.</p>

<p>Just wait until the entire planet, and everyone on it, gets a reliable high speed connection. It is not if but when.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Alex</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PS: I know that I am throwing generalities and I hope you can forgive me for the point that I am trying to illustrate.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>PPS: Sorry for the clickbait title‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut how else am I going to get you to read about software ethics? Not trying to single out mothers or family members or friends. I am trying to make a point that you should make your work relatable. Think about your end user. There is an actual person sitting on the other side of your code. And guess what? This person is trusting you and your code.</p>
