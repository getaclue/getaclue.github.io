I believe in engineering and science principles. They are at my core and drive me forward.</p><p>Unfortunately, I feel like I am not doing a good job in reflecting and sharing that with you. What happens usually is that I open up a blank canvas, such as this one, and just start writing. Usually I have a topic or a direction that motivates me to write. However, I do not consider if I will publish or delete the content at the time of writing it.</p><p>This is what I mean by a blank canvas in September 2018: <img src="/assets/images/2018-09-28/Screen-Shot-2018-09-29-at-12.12.33.png" alt="Blank canvas" /></p><p>As a result, I have a lot of written content spread out across various computers, domains, and publications. A lot of this content is not published and, if taken out of context, may seem like a waste of my time. Personally, I find it very difficult to hit that publish button for many reasons.</p><p>To me, writing is cathartic in a sense — the single purpose is to remove the content from my head. When the ideas are out of my head and on a canvas then I can play with them. In my head there is chaos, so I like to consolidate my ideas and to make sense of them. To tease out my views and opinions (and to correct them).</p><p>If you take this into consideration, then perhaps you can see why some of my pieces don’t get my approval and thus never see the light. However, the longer I live on this earth, the more I wish I didn’t hold back and just publish (whether or not it is finished). So, I decided to actively work on this.</p><p>One of my goals for 2018 was to publish more frequent written updates. The intention was not only to improve the quality of my written content but also to documenting a process.</p><p><em>It is the end of September. Month #9 is almost done. So how have I been doing?</em></p><p>On the whole, I have been doing way better than any of my previous years. If you take a look at this year alone, I have published 11 pieces of work so far. Some of them even required a lot of additional work. Gasp!!! One thing for sure — I have been staying consistent. Whatever that means to me.</p><p>If I take a look at it this way, then my progress is happening. I am growing and developing. However, during my day-to-day thinking it feels more negative. I feel like I could be doing better in this area. I still find myself falling into the trap of not publishing. Reflecting on this progress definitely helps to stay on track.</p><p>So, I think I am doing OK even if it doesn’t feel like that. I give myself the permission to make mistakes, publish more frequent and unfinished work; and continue this journey that I started.</p><h2 id="what-happened-since-the-last-post">What happened since the last <a href="/blog/i-have-to-come-clean-about-my-project">post</a>?</h2><ul><li>in June/July/August, I finished the backend &amp; frontend MVP for dailyvibes<ul><li>the said backend and frontend are not live yet to anyone but you may see some things <a href="https://github.com/dailyvibes">here</a></li><li>PS, as an aside — I am considering migrating away from github to self-hosted for all of my work</li></ul></li><li>in July, worked on <a href="https://screenhole.net/">screenhole</a> and created an MVP for a Mac OS screen recorder functionality. That was a fun experiment that you can view at <a href="https://screenhole.net/getaclue/~g8U2vv">https://screenhole.net/getaclue/~g8U2vv</a> Unfortunately that is not a public feature and is stuck in alpha/beta stage until further notice.</li><li>in July/August, worked on <a href="https://keyframes.net/">keyframes</a> native Mac app. Was a bit of work but looks nice in my opinion. This work is in <a href="https://keyframes.net/snapper/beta">beta</a> and is available for download.</li><li>in August, launched our <a href="https://cspray.ca/">physical product</a> at the <a href="https://theex.com/">Canadian National Exhibition</a>. That was intense. Will talk about this more at a later time ;-) but lets just say we are continuing working on this project. This was a FIRST for us and also a BIG deal!!!<ul><li><code>Attendance: 1.54 million (2016)</code> — may hint to you at why. And we made sure to talk to almost everyone that passed by us. I say almost because it was just the two of us.</li></ul></li><li>in September, started to work on news article parser for <a href="https://elderoost.com/">elderoost</a>. One of the current challenges is keeping up to news. I physically read all of the articles manually and filter them manually. This honestly takes a lot of time. If you check the website the latest article was added <code>5 months ago</code>. I have all of the articles since then I just haven’t processed them yet.<ul><li>current working approach:<ul><li>get news article link</li><li>go to the link</li><li>grab the URL, title, headline, author, date of publication, and the content<ul><li>I found a script that helps with grabbing all of this (similar to how some browsers allow you to have a read an html page in plain text if you click a button)</li></ul></li><li>put this stuff into postgres db</li><li>index title and content using elasticsearch</li><li>for each residence search against this text</li></ul></li><li>unfortunately it is not done as I cannot narrow down some edge cases.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="and-what-am-i-up-to-now">and what am I up to now?</h2><ul><li>job search<ul><li>After 2 years and some, I think it is time as there aren’t any new opportunities for growth as a software engineer where I am</li><li>The work moved to a new physical location that is more challenging to commute to</li><li>My school debt is causing me a lot of stress and anxiety… so I’d like to pay this off faster.</li><li>I am not being paid what I know I could be for someone with my needed skills<ul><li>I stayed because of the team but that recently got dissolved</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>cspray</li><li>dailyvibes<ul><li>add user auth functionality on ios<ul><li>make user auth functionality work between ios and server</li><li>make a sync mechanism between ios and server (probably manual for now and then automate)</li></ul></li><li>modify the way you share links within iOS (add a new area so it is easier to share)<ul><li>share these links from iOS to server (after the user stuff is linked up)</li></ul></li><li>provision a server on DO or Linode<ul><li>glue the backend &amp; frontend on this server</li><li>glue the server to dailyvibes domain</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>elderoost<ul><li>finish news article parser</li><li>add a notifyer after this is done to manually review</li><li>figure out monetization</li></ul></li></ul><p>… in that order I think.</p><p>Now, I’m going to spend the next little while grinding cracking the coding interview bible and all of the typical hackerrank websites. It is a bit unfortunate that I need to put a pause on the side projects to do this. But it is what it is. (Especially if you want to work for the typical Fortune N company.)</p><hr /><p>And for those of you that finished reading this, here is some behind the scenes context to this article. It is an example of a written piece that I ended up <a href="/blog/would-you-let-your-mother-use-your-software">publishing</a>. It started off as a <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway app</a> draft and then, eventually, I approved and transformed it into an article.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/2018-09-28/Screen-Shot-2018-09-29-at-11.35.50.png" alt="Sample written piece that I ended up sharing" /></p></div><span class="meta" ><time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2018-09-29T00:00:00-04:00" >September 29, 2018</time > &middot; <a href="/tag/software engineering">software engineering</a>, <a href="/tag/doubt">doubt</a></span > <!--<span class="meta"><time datetime="2018-09-29T00:00:00-04:00">September 29, 2018</time> &middot; <a class="post" href="/tag/software engineering">software engineering</a>, <a class="post" href="/tag/doubt">doubt</a></span> --></article></main></body></html>
