I"ï<p>So, Iâ€™ve decided to do a few challenges for the month of October:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do at least 1 problem on leetcode per day</li>
  <li>write and publish 1 thing per day</li>
</ul>

<p>A few minutes ago, I was having a blast while fighting with the following maintenance that I am undergoing for <a href="https://dailyvibes.ca">daily vibes</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2018-10-02/xcode-battles.png" alt="Xcode decided to not play along" /></p>

<p>While customers do not care about such background things, I am beginning to see what people mean about upgrade headaches. And, thus, I stopped for today. No more wasting time on lower priority things. I then proceeded to write instead. I wanted to say two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I am trying really hard to stay committed to the problem solving challenge. Not going to lie right now â€” not looking forward to it right now but I am looking forward to looking back at this time and laughing about it.</li>
  <li>Writing something every day and then publishing it is, also, not going to be easy. It is an experiment for me that I hope you enjoy whenever you read this. Perhaps, you will see what improvements can occur through deliberate practice in just a few days.</li>
</ol>

<p>See you tomorrow.</p>
