<h2 id="long-about-me">Long about me:</h2>

<p>Hello, friend. Alex here. I am a software engineering graduate living in Hamilton, Canada. I graduated magna cum laude from <a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/en">University of Ottawa</a>. I mention this because it means a lot to me. I was afraid of the challenges that come with completing an engineering degree curriculum. It took a lot of effort and hard work.</p>

<p>I am interested in all aspects of the software engineering discipline. To prove my dedication beyond obtaining an accredited software engineering degree, I am in the process of obtaining my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_and_licensure_in_engineering#Canada_2">professional engineering (P.Eng) license</a>. I am currently in the <a href="http://peo.on.ca/index.php?ci_id=2064&amp;la_id=1" title="The Engineering Intern (EIT) Program">EIT</a> stage. As it is illegal in Canada to call yourself a Software Engineer without an engineering license, hopefully this shines some light on any confusion around my <em>Software Engineer, <a href="http://peo.on.ca/index.php?ci_id=2064&amp;la_id=1" title="The Engineering Intern (EIT) Program">EIT</a></em> title.</p>

<p>My career path has not been so straightforward. You can check out my <a href="/projects">projects page</a> to see my adventures. The common denominator along all my various career paths has been people. I enjoy helping people and businesses solve their problems. I strive to leave whatever I work on in a better state than I found it. My life‚Äôs goal is to be helpful to people by being great at creating and maintaining usable software.</p>

<h2 id="other-interests">Other interests</h2>

<p>As you know, I also have a degree in Psychology. I went into the degree without any interest and with the single goal of applying to medical schools. I stayed to learn about people. My honours thesis was <em>‚ÄúAn fMRI investigation of working memory in chemotherapy-treated breast cancer patients‚Äù</em>. I was interested in Neuroscience and was given an opportunity to work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging">fMRI</a>.</p>

<p>I enjoy knowledge for its own sake. I explore other disciplines to understand our ever-changing world. Also, I use such opportunity in attempts to connect different disciplines to software. The future of software lies in cross-disciplinary solutions.</p>

<p>I am also interested in business and entrepreneurship. Here is a video of my adventures during the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/business-and-economy/start-summer-company-students">Ontario Summer Company 2014 Entrepreneurial Grant</a>:</p>
