<h2 id="assume">Assume:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>let T = nonempty binary tree</li>
  <li>let n = number of nodes</li>
  <li>let n_e = number of external nodes</li>
  <li>let n_i = number of internal nodes</li>
  <li>let h = height of T</li>

<h2 id="then-t-has-following-properties">Then, T has following properties:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>height of the nonempty binary tree + 1 <strong>is less than or equal to</strong> the number of nodes in the binary tree <strong>is less than or equal to</strong> 2^(height of the nonempty binary tree + 1) — 1</li>
  <li>1 <strong>is less than or equal to</strong> number of external nodes in the nonempty binary tree <strong>is less than or equal to</strong> 2^(height of the nonempty binary tree)</li>
  <li>height of the nonempty binary tree <strong>is less than or equal to</strong> number of internal nodes of the nonempty binary tree <strong>is less than or equal to</strong> 2^(height of nonempty binary tree) — 1</li>
  <li>log of (number of nodes in nonempty binary tree) — 1 <strong>is less than or equal to</strong> height of the nonempty binary tree <strong>is less than or equal to</strong> number of nodes in nonempty binary tree — 1</li>
</ol>

<p>… sorry this was one was also not finished :’-(</p>

<p>for context plan was to illustrate this using 3djs</p>

<p>See you next time</p>
