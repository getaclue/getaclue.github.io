<h2 id="apple-store">Apple Store</h2>

<p>I uploaded <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/id1332324033?mt=8&amp;at=1010lK7Y">Daily Vibes</a> to the Apple App Store simply because I wanted to have it out there rather than keep it under wraps. I figured I would add value to the software as I go. In retrospect, it was a good decision because it allowed me to find value quicker (as opposed to when I was working on the app under wraps).</p>

<p>After listening to some <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/show-ih-daily-vibes-ios-80a69b4368">feedback on IndieHackers</a> I decided to start working on ASO (Apple Store Optimization). Signed up for Apple’s Ads. Signed up for their Affiliate program. Started researching.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-have-learned-so-far">What I have learned so far:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Title matters</li>
  <li>Description matters</li>
  <li>Keywords matter</li>
  <li>Having screenshots ??? apparently matters</li>
  <li>Having a video ?? apparently matters</li>
  <li>Description and other stuff that you have to fill in… doesn’t matter</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-else-i-have-learned">What else I have learned?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>What you actually put in any of those fields doesn’t really matter. Don’t get attached to your App name, App Description, Keywords or anything else to do with it. This is important for indie developers with no ad budget. Why? Because we want to be found so people use our software.</li>
  <li>If you have a budget then you can pick your Branding carefully and you can ignore what I said above</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, while working on improving Daily Vibes I am also looking at improving my overall marketing. I am going to do it iteratively and learn along the way.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="what-is-my-plan-of-attack">What is my plan of attack?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>improve title (Daily Vibes ➡️ Daily Vibes: Life Task Manager)</li>
  <li>improve subtitle (Todo List &amp; Life Day Organizer ➡️ To do list, life day organizer)</li>
  <li>improve keywords; currently haven’t decided:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>to-do, list app, list maker, task list, todo list, list, task, todo, to do, life organizer, daily</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>todo,list,organizer,tracker,task,project,things,productivity,to do,to-do,keep,reminder,day planner</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>life organizer, good vibes, daily tasks, daily office, daily calender,
daily lists, daily organizer, lists maker,</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>make screenshots localized with pretty text (via <a href="fastlane.tools">fastlane.tools</a>) … something like:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/LcaVFa+" alt="LocalizedScreenshot sample" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>make AND edit AND upload a video</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/cmP5EE+" alt="Video WIP Screenshot" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>improve aforementioned screenshots</li>
  <li>improve aforementioned video</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these ideas are up in the air while I am writing this post. I am hoping to ship them with next release, hopefully sometime next week. Then, I will have to wait and look at the analytics.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>A lot of work goes behind the scenes for a single app. I am beginning to appreciate indie developers and their successful products. You really need to be comfortable with wearing ALL of the hats that make a successful business.</p>

<p>For me, marketing is an uncharted area and I was hesitant to start learning it. But look at me now, I can make icons, promo videos, and start being strategic about growth. It is a journey that I am enjoying but it is challenging.</p>

<p>I also paved the road and did all of the necessary paper work to add in app subscriptions. Now I just gotta figure out my strategy in this area ;)</p>

<p>Oh and in closing news, I wanted to keep to a somewhat relaxed 2 week shipping cycle… and so far I have been sticking to the schedule of regular updates =) I hope I can keep this up!</p>

<p>Thank you for reading and until next time my friend.</p>
