<ul>
  <li>not using <a href="https://www.fastmail.com">fastmail</a> â€“ I currently paused on using fastmail for a more affordable <a href="https://privateemail.com">namecheap email</a> alternative. It works just fine for now.</li>
  <li>Took a pause â€“ last year was intense and required me to take a pause. I had a lot of personal issues last year that took time away from all of my previously enjoyed side projects. Thus, I had to put most of them on pause. Taking a pause really threw a wrench in my motivation and my previous velocity.</li>
  <li>Elderoost - also happens that someone purchased elderoost.com as I paused on the project. Very weird; oh well. All of the data and the actual project is offline. The project currently is currently on pause as I learn django. Goal is to re-write the project using Python.</li>
  <li>Daily Vibes - I did not repay my Appleâ€™s developer fee so my project is not available from the Apple store any longer. I can show you the project in person if you like. Project is on pause for now. I still have ideas on returning to the project however. I am considering a re-write for version 2 â€“ I will probably pay for the developer fees only as I get closer to production. Been thinking of rewriting in React Native or something cross-platform.</li>
  <li>daily 15 minutes of reading</li>
  <li>daily 30 minutes of software</li>
  <li>being deliberate about daily practice</li>
  <li>building better habbits</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="attacking-weaknesses">Attacking weaknesses</h3>

<p>For me, the best way to attack my weaknesses is to, first, identify them. Sometimes this takes a lot of effort because you need to be systematic about your days. Best way to record and identify this is to use a diary or a journal. I am currently attacking my two weaknesses that I want to be more productive in :</p>

<ol>
  <li>regular software / programming and</li>
  <li>regular reading.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am reading for at least 15 minutes per day. I am doing a 30 minutes a day programming activity. At this moment, I am learning python language and django framework. I hope to move on to 30 minutes a day of regular programming. I will then move on to the competitive programming to get ready for interviews. However, I am hoping to acquire new skills such that I would be ready for future interviews on a shorter schedule. Current timeline, goal is to be ready for summer.</p>

<p>Some recent excerpts from the Flow Book :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Without the goal and the challenges usually provided by a job, only a rare self-discipline can keep the mind focused intensely enough to insure a meaningful life.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When spending time at home with the famÂ­ily or alone, people often lack a clear purpose, do not know how well they are doing, are distracted, feel that their skills are underutilized, and as a result feel bored or-more rarely anxious.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In our ESM studies we find that even physical health is better when a person focuses on a goal. On weekends, when alone, and with nothing to do, people report more symptoms of illness.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In other words, each of the flow-producing activities requires an initial investment of attention before it begins to be enjoyable.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When productive activities become too routine and meaningless, leisure will pick up the slack. It will take up progressively more time, and rely on inÂ­creasingly more elaborate artificial stimulation.</p>
</blockquote>
