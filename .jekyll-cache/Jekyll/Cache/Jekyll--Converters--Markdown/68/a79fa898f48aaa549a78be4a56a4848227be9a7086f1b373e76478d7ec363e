I"ê<p>I feel like having your own portfolio on the web is a must for a software craftperson. I think that the old way of not needing a portfolio is not going to last.</p>

<p>If you want to compete for a remote position or have an online business, you need a portfolio of your work and services. The portfolio is a way to show your customer why they should pick you.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-portfolio-">What is a portfolio ?</h2>

<p>To me, this website is my portfolio.</p>

<p>It is a collection of works and description of those works.</p>

<h2 id="problems">Problem(s)</h2>

<p>One of the challenges with having the portfolio is knowing what to put on it. After all, the portfolio is a public. Another challenge is to know what level of details to put into the descriptions. Who is the target reader? Does that matter?</p>

<p>For my portfolio, I started it all with a blog. As time went, and I developed skills, I added a projects section. I tried to explain each project via the technologies used, screenshots, and live links. I do not think that my descriptions fit my portfolio anymore. The projects page has become more than a wall of text.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>Now, it is time to improve my portfolio and add a case study section. This section will allow me to expand on each project in a systematic way. I will explore examples of case studies and then apply the approach to my projects.</p>

<p>At the moment, I will be incorporating <a href="https://designthings.fun">this guide</a>, for emerging designers today, to my <del>website</del> porfolio.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-09-04/design-things.png" alt="designthings.fun" /></p>

<p>I will be using <del>three</del> one of their checklists</p>

<ol>
  <li><del>One for the entire website</del></li>
  <li>One for a case study section on the website</li>
  <li><del>One for website presentation</del></li>
</ol>

<p>I am excited to be exploring the case study improvement to my portfolio. I plan to do a retro on each of the closed projects and talk about them in depth.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>Portfolios are important and work on them never ends. I will be adding case studies. Maybe.</p>
