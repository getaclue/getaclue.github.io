<p><a href="https://learnnodejs.dev">Learn Node.js</a> – is a free book that I wrote about getting up to speed with fullstack javascript development during COVID-19 (March-May 2020). This book is perfect for someone who isn’t sure how everything in node.js works. In this book I outline the design and development of common application features using javascript. The implementation of which are then transferable to other projects and languages.</p>
