I"L<p>Sometimes, I find it hard to keep my thoughts coherent and focused on a single task for a fixed amount of time. What happens in my mind is that my brain puts all tasks at the same importance level. Then my mind brings those tasks to my attention as I am chugging away at a task.</p>

<p>Therefore, it becomes challenging to context switch. I do not know how to treat a task as more important.</p>

<p>When I do switch from a task to another task, my mind begins to worry about not working on a different task. This becomes a negative loop of sorts.</p>

<p>When I get into this mode, I spend chunks of time switching between different tasks. I spend time worrying and being anxious. However, not much gets accomplished.</p>

<p>Writing things down and creating smallest accomplishable tasks appear to aid in escaping this terrible mode.</p>
