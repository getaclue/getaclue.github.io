I"~<p>I learned recently : if I am procrastinating then I may have a challenging problem somewhere that I am avoiding.</p>

<p>I tend to be pretty good at knowing when I procrastinate. Certain habits or certain rituals – I just know that I am procrastinating.</p>

<p>For me, it gets tricky when procrastinating is me working on a personal project. I like creating; it keeps me busy; and I am following my passions. How can that be procrastinating!? Some activities do not seem like a procrastinating activity at first.</p>

<p>So instead of being mad at myself for procrastinating I started to ask myself why I am procrastinating. As a result, this enables me to :</p>

<ol>
  <li>catch myself in the middle of procrastinating</li>
  <li>figure out what it is that I am avoiding</li>
  <li>decide if to continue procrastinating</li>
</ol>

<p>Procrastination doesn’t have to be negative.</p>
