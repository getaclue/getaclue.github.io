I"<<p>I decided to learn about bash scripting in order to encrypt all of my pictures and movies before uploading them. More specifically, I wanted individual encryption and not an encryption of an entire archive of pictures and movies.</p>

<p>This is an exercise in improving my backups. I have a habit of not downloading an entire archive because the size of an archive is typically large. To solve this problem, I want to mimick my entire library by preserving the file structure on a server. However, I wanted to have all of my files encrypted prior to having them uploaded.</p>

<p>I think that by sampling a few files out of an uploaded directory will allow me to speed up my recovery as compared to downloading the entire archive. Therefore, I needed a way to encrypt and decrypt my files.</p>

<p>Goals that I wanted to achieve for encryption:</p>

<ul>
  <li>automated</li>
  <li>password had to be entered as an argument</li>
  <li>cipher had to be chosen as an argument</li>
  <li>after encryption all of the file names had to remain original</li>
  <li>all JPG files had to be encrypted individually</li>
  <li>every encrypted file had to be saved into /enc/ folder with the original file name</li>
</ul>

<p>Goals that I wanted to achieve for decryption:</p>

<ul>
  <li>automated</li>
  <li>password and cipher entered as arguments</li>
  <li>all decrypted files had to maintain its original file name</li>
  <li>all JPG files decrypted individually</li>
  <li>every decrypted file had to be saved into /dec/ folder with the original file name</li>
</ul>
