I"K<p>I began to write my <code class="highlighter-rouge">Learn Node.js</code> (working title) book last month. It is a self-published book project. The aim of the book is to help developers, switching to javascript and node.js, to hit the ground running by building and uploading a functional project. By going through the book you will be able to build features that modern javascript applications require.</p>

<p>My current plan is to self publish and I will be doing that using <a href="https://gumroad.com/">gumroad</a>; then I will upload a copy on iBooks store; and checkout amazonâ€™s self publishing via kindle. In all three scenarios, a pdf output of the book is perfect. So, the final version of my book will be available for purchase in at least the pdf format. <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/">Asciidoc</a> documents are perfectly converted to pdf format using <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-pdf/">asciidoctor-pdf</a>.</p>

<p>I began writing my book using iBooks Author authoring tool with the intention of publishing the book on the iBooks store. However, as I progressed in my writing process, I realized that my book contained quite a bit of code blocks. I wrote about this <a href="./asciidoc-vs-ibooks-author">earlier</a> but I ended up fully re-doing my work and switching away from iBooks Author authoring tool.</p>

<p>Quite honestly, lack of beautiful code blocks (once converted to pdf) is why I switched my writing into <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/">asciidoc</a> format. For images, so far I have been fortunate to use a combination of screenshots and adobe photoshop software.</p>

<p>For more involved diagrams, I opted out to use <a href="http://plantuml.com/">plantuml</a> for diagram creation. It works pretty good and allows you to maintain your images in plain text format for backups or quick adjustments.</p>

<p>I spent a few hours killing time by working on the book cover marketing material. I found <a href="https://www.freepik.com/">https://www.freepik.com/</a> to have many wonderful book cover mockups for free. There are also paid alternatives. Point isâ€¦ finding a beautiful cover may take some time =)</p>

<p>To summarize:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>write using <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/">asciidoc</a> using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">vs code</a> or <a href="https://www.asciidocfx.com/">asciidocfx</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>convert <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/">asciidoc</a> to pdf using something like <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-pdf/">asciidoctor-pdf</a> or <a href="https://www.asciidocfx.com/">asciidocfx</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To publish the pdf book on <a href="https://gumroad.com/">gumroad</a> one just needs to make an account.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To publish the pdf book to iBooks, one needs to connect your iCloud, in iTunes Connect, to Apple Books <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201183">like so</a>. And then you need to download iTunes Producer to upload your book to their store.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To publish the pdf book to Amazon, one needs an amazon account and then head over to the <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US">kindle direct publishing</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Oh yes, <a href="https://leanpub.com/">leanpub</a> is another option if you would like to stick to markdown and not interested in learning the power of <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/">asciidoc</a>.</p>

<p>Happy writing!</p>
