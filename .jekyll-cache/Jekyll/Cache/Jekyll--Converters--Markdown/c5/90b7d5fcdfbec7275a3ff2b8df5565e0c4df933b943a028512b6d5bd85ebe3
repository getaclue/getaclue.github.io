<p>I can view this comment through my Canadian glasses =) Having worked in academia, private, and, now, government environments at various levels — I can definitely appreciate the intricacies that go behind the scenes.</p>

<p>While we <strong>are</strong> different countries, we follow similar implementations of organizational structures. We most likely use similar enterprise hardware and software. I also assume that applications of these things are similar in US and Canada. I further assume that such organizations have similar goals (perhaps different strategies).</p>

<p>So when I see something like the following</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It has already worked with the DoD and multiple law enforcement agencies have used its facial recognition system – Rekognition. Amazon employees and civil liberties organizations <strong>claimed that the software could be used [to] violate human rights</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>it makes me stop and think about the various things that could be going on during these discussions. Things that are not even about the technology <em>per se</em>.</p>

<p>Organizations, like a government or some equivalent, usually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_proposal">need</a> something. These needs are then distributed down their vines using the appropriate channels. So if a need <strong>was</strong> distributed then that means a bunch of things happened and it was approved. Where am I going with this? While I am using very big generalities, I am just trying to say that maybe other angles could be explored.</p>

<hr />

<p>I found the following article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1">AOMedia Video 1</a> — very confusing at first.</p>

<p>AV1 is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… meant to succeed its predecessor VP9 and compete with HEVC/H.265 from the Moving Picture Experts Group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The confusing part was that Apple is involved in the HEVC/H.265 format AND in this format (because they are part of Alliance for Open Media). But as I read on I realized why:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HEVC/H.265 is royalty <em>bearing</em></li>
  <li>AV1 is royalty <em>free</em></li>
</ul>

<p>So that makes sence =)</p>

<p>Also noticing that I am spending way too much on these and that was never the intention. I keep editing or deleting. My focus is on interview prep. Anywho, see you next time =)</p>
