I"<	<p>If you are not producing projects, writing, or contributing socially and you are a software person, are you growing? I have been experiencing a bit of FOMO. You see, last year I kind of went on a social diet of sorts and reduced my presence on social platforms. One of the negative outcomes of this, is my lack of output during this time.</p>

<p>Now you see, I have had output at work but that does not satisfy me. I don’t have a thing that I can show or talk about that is interesting on average.</p>

<p>It seems that in this software craftperson field, you need to be methodical about your work plus document it. Plus… plus… you need to showcase it somehow. A portfolio is kind of a must in our software field. At least for now, since I don’t know what the future holds. I mean, architects and artists have a portfolio that they carry and showcase. I suppose, why not software craftpersons as well?</p>

<p>The projects don’t have to be finished or in a perfect state, any state will do well as a showcase of your work. The older I grow, the more happy I am that I keep some of my chaotic work on this domain.</p>

<p>I need to work a bit more to describe the various projects and work that I did throughout the years. I hope that by writing more frequently in this blog I will be more attune with my thought process.</p>

<p>I think I prefer to think of my work as a constant flow of never ending ideas. A stream of consciousness that seems to be the right thing to do at the right time. This space is where I record it.</p>

<p>I will try <em>yet again</em> to be less critical and be more permissive at recording and producing output.</p>

<p><em>They</em> say that you should not worry and just make for the sake of making. While, that is true … it helps to document that work in THIS field.</p>
