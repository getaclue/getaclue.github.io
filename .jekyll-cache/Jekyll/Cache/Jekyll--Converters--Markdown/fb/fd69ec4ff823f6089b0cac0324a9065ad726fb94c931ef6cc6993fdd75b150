<p>Hi friends,</p>

<h2 id="before-we-begin">Before we begin</h2>

<p>Before I begin, I am assuming you are already running your UITests using <a href="https://fastlane.tools/">fastlane.tools</a>. If not, I would suggest that you get yourself familiarized <a href="https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/screenshots/">here</a>. It saves you lots of time and it is especially indispensable for solo developers like myself.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-this-article-about">What is this article about?</h2>

<p>This article is about improving your iOS marketing material: the screenshots.</p>

<p>So, we will go from this:</p>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/FuVdCb+" alt="Starting point" /></p>

<p>to this:</p>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/7vkqhx+" alt="Goal of this article" /></p>

<p>We will be using <a href="https://fastlane.tools/">fastlane.tools</a> in combination with <a href="https://github.com/shinydevelopment/SimulatorStatusMagic">SimulatorStatusMagic</a> library. SimulatorStatusMagic is used to create the perfect status bar:</p>

<ul>
  <li>9:41 AM is displayed for the time</li>
  <li>The battery is full and shows 100%</li>
  <li>On iPhone: The carrier text is removed, 5 bars of cellular signal and full WiFi bars are displayed.</li>
  <li>On iPad: The carrier text is set to ‚ÄúiPad‚Äù and full WiFi bars are displayed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The text above is taken verbatim from the library‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/shinydevelopment/SimulatorStatusMagic">description</a>.</p>

<h2 id="why-would-you-want-to-do-that">Why would you want to do that?</h2>

<p>Well, such attention to detail adds extra value to your product by making your marketing material that much better than your competition. If you take a second to scan the Apple App store, the top apps provide some level of consistency in their marketing material. It follows, you should work towards achieving a similar level of consistency because it is not really not that hard. And if you set this up once, it will work.</p>

<p>So, I wanted to the improve the screenshots that I use to market <a href="https://dailyvibes.ca/">Daily Vibes</a> in my next update.</p>

<h2 id="what-did-i-try">What did I try?</h2>

<p>Installed SimulatorStatusMagic using cocoapods by adding the following line to my Podfile, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">pod 'SimulatorStatusMagic', :configurations =&gt; ['Debug']
</code></pre>

<p>Next, I found the following <a href="https://funkenstrahlen.de/blog/2016/04/21/perfekte-ios-screenshots/">two</a> <a href="http://blog.scottlogic.com/2015/02/25/Using-Snapshot-with-Simulator-Status-Magic-to-generate-perfect-iOS-screenshots.html">articles</a> and they gave me good starting points. They were perfect for me because I wanted to use flags in my code like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/CVcNIW+" alt="How I wanted to import the library" /></p>

<p>This would allow me to only import SimulatorStatusMagic during fastlane.tools run.</p>

<p>And, I also envisioned using this one flag throughout other areas of the code.</p>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/M0QqzC+" alt="What I envisioned" /></p>

<p>So‚Ä¶ putting it all together, I wanted something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/B53hS7+" alt="How I wanted fastlane.tools and SimulatorStatusMagic to work" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But, I could not get it to run exactly like that üò≠</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really wanted to get this to work. However, as a result of <a href="https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/search?q=custom_args&amp;type=Issues&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93">these</a> <a href="https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/4717">issues</a> you need some tweaking in 2018.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-is-my-curent-solution">So what is my curent solution?</h2>

<ol>
  <li><code>import SimulatorStatusMagic</code></li>
  <li>leverage snapshot‚Äôs <a href="https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/screenshots/#advanced-snapshot">launch arguments</a> - <code>FASTLANE_SNAPSHOT</code> is set to true</li>
  <li>call in code as you wanted</li>
</ol>

<pre><code class="language-rb">if NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults().boolForKey("FASTLANE_SNAPSHOT") {
...
  SDStatusBarManager.sharedInstance().enableOverrides()
  setupScreenshotData()
...
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the code above works ‚Ä¶ but I will be first to admit that it is not the perfect solution.</p>

<p>As it is currently written, you will need to play the commenting game:</p>

<ul>
  <li>comment out import SimulatorStatusMagic and</li>
  <li>comment out SDStatusBarManager.sharedInstance().enableOverrides()</li>
</ul>

<p>during regular development and do the reverse during fastlane.tools run.</p>

<p>So‚Ä¶ during regular development:</p>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/ptOZ9a+" alt="What you have to do during regular development" /></p>

<p>and ‚Ä¶ during fastlane.tools run:</p>

<p><img src="https://d.pr/i/DCDj9W+" alt="What you have to do during fastlane.tools run" /></p>

<p>As I am familiar with Ruby and Swift, and can get by with Objective-C, I tried to make it work how I wanted and find the source of confusion. I did look at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/xcodebuild.1.html">xcodebuild arguments</a> and scanned fastlane.tools source <a href="https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/snapshot/lib/snapshot/test_command_generator_base.rb#L34">code up to here</a>. But, since there is only so much time in the day and I work on this during my free time - I did not narrow down the problem.</p>

<p>So if you have a different solution that allows me to run the code how I wanted, please reach out to me via <a href="https://twitter.com/getaclue_1">twitter</a>. I will gladly adjust this article to incorporate those changes.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I hope that you enjoy this working solution. I was puzzled during my research in 2018 and I did not see a solution so hopefully this helps someone in upping their screenshot game.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading,</p>

<p>Alex</p>
