**requirement** :

- (a) condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective;
- (b) condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed document;
- (c) documented representation of a condition or capavility as in definition (a) or (b)

# A. Concept exploration

I can perform the necessary competitor analysis and feasibility assessment of a project. This process is usually done prior to the requirements engineering phase. Here, system exploration and concept exploration are the main goals.

> Output available : competition analysis, feasibility analysis

# B. Requirements engineering

One aspect of progress in software development involves matching requirements to working code. This way a project can be managed and everyone is aware of what is going to happen. Requirements engineering gives us tools to create such documents if they do not exist. Basically, translate your vision into tangible product management items. I can help you understand exactly what you want and that way you can estimate better.

> Output available : requirements specifications; stakeholder analysis; user stories

# C. UX / UI design and development

The second most important aspect of translating your vision into reality is to have a rough idea of what your software will do and will look like before coding it. To minimize the potential risk for productivity loss in the future via bad coding, I ensure that I can provide the proper specification documents so there are no surprises.

> Output available : ux wireframes, ui mockups

# D. Software development

Once the necessary software requirements and specification documents are produced, software development can begin. This is the process of translating requirements into working software via code. A 1-to-1 between documents and code is possible via the practice of unit testing. If all of the components are following proper software engineering practices then one can outsource the documents to be built by anyone cable of reading them.

> Output available : working software, code repository, deployed software, scripts, scraping, automation

# E. Software verification

Did you just acquire software but need some someone to double check that it does what you think it does? Need a 3rd party to verify that requirements were met in code?

> Output available : software verification document

# F. Other
