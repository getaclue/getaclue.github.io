## Hello üëã I'm Alex and I work with software

Welcome to my little corner of the Internet. As all things go on the internet, unless mentioned otherwise, content that you may find here is not affiliated with my work or employer.

## üìå Quick about me:

- I am a Software Engineer, <a href="http://peo.on.ca/index.php?ci_id=2064&la_id=1" title="The Engineering Intern (EIT) Program">EIT</a>
- I live in beautiful Hamilton, Ontario
- I am employed full-time

I also went to school and hold two complementary undergraduate degrees awarded from [University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/en):

- [one in Software Engineering](https://www.uottawa.ca/academic/info/regist/1516/calendars/programs/1459.html)
- [one in Psychology](https://socialsciences.uottawa.ca/programs/undergraduate-course-sequences/honours-bsc-psychology)

## ‚úÖ How can I help?

I am a software engineer at heart. That means that I am trained to solve customer's business problems by the systematic development and evolution of large, high-quality software systems within cost, time, and other constraints.

Please see my [services offered page](/services). You can always contact me about a special case.

## üÜò With what technology?

I am always learning and experimenting on my own time. My computer science foundation, coupled with software engineering training, allows me to quickly jump into any code base and any language.

- computer science foundation using Java and C
- enjoying JavaScript lately
- familiar with Ruby (Ruby on Rails, Sinatra)
- familiar with Javascript (Next.js, Node.js, React, React Native, Ember, ES2016, ES2017, and ES2018)
- familiar with HTML5
- familiar with CSS3/SASS/Less
- familiar with multi-language and accessibility compliance
- familiar with cross-platform development
- familiar with cross-browser development
- familiar with continuous deployment (codeship, travis, jenkins)
- familiar in \*nix environments
- familiar with Swift
- able to work with Objective-C
- new in iOS development (since November 2017)
- new in OS X development (since April 2018)

I am open to learning new technology.

## üìö Long about me:

Hello, friend. Alex here. I am a software engineering graduate living in Hamilton, Canada. I graduated magna cum laude from [University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/en). I mention this because it means a lot to me. I was afraid of the challenges that come with completing an engineering degree curriculum. It took a lot of effort and hard work.

I am interested in all aspects of the software engineering discipline. To prove my dedication beyond obtaining an accredited software engineering degree, I am in the process of obtaining my [professional engineering (P.Eng) license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_and_licensure_in_engineering#Canada_2). I am currently in the <a href="http://peo.on.ca/index.php?ci_id=2064&la_id=1" title="The Engineering Intern (EIT) Program">EIT</a> stage. As it is illegal in Canada to call yourself a Software Engineer without an engineering license, hopefully this shines some light on any confusion around my _Software Engineer, <a href="http://peo.on.ca/index.php?ci_id=2064&la_id=1" title="The Engineering Intern (EIT) Program">EIT</a>_ title.

My career path has not been so straightforward. You can check out my [projects page](/projects) to see my adventures. The common denominator along all my various career paths has been people. I enjoy helping people and businesses solve their problems. I strive to leave whatever I work on in a better state than I found it. My life's goal is to be helpful to people by being great at creating and maintaining usable software.

## üë®‚Äçüî¨ Other interests

As you know, I also have a degree in Psychology. I went into the degree without any interest and with the single goal of applying to medical schools. I stayed to learn about people. My honours thesis was _"An fMRI investigation of working memory in chemotherapy-treated breast cancer patients"_. I was interested in Neuroscience and was given an opportunity to work with [fMRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging).

I enjoy knowledge for its own sake. I explore other disciplines to understand our ever-changing world. Also, I use such opportunity in attempts to connect different disciplines to software. The future of software lies in cross-disciplinary solutions.

I am also interested in business and entrepreneurship. Here is a video of my adventures during the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/business-and-economy/start-summer-company-students">Ontario Summer Company 2014 Entrepreneurial Grant</a>:
