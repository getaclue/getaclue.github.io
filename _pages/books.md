Book that I wrote and released :

## Learn Node.js (2020)

![Learn Node.js]({{"assets/images/books/learn-nodejs.png" | relative_url}})

[Learn Node.js](https://learnnodejs.dev) -- is a free book that I wrote about getting up to speed with fullstack javascript development during COVID-19 (March-May 2020). This book is perfect for someone who isn't sure how everything in node.js works. In this book I outline the design and development of common application features using javascript. The implementation of which are then transferable to other projects and languages.
