### 2016 - Present

Work on a custom <mark>enterprise e-learning</mark> platform. This work includes new feature work, maintenance, and regression testing. In addition to platform maintenance, I create e-learning content using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for clients. Ensure that the work is WCAG accessible and language compliant.

Regular communications to keep client relations via emails, telephone, or in person. Moreover, I was given the opportunity to apply my software engineering chops in the research and development of platform modernization. This included requirements gathering, company outreach, and off-the-shelf enterprise software evaluation.
