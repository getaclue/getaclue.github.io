As I continue my path as a software craftsman, I will try to maintain an ongoing record of my work. I'm always happy to chat about my current or previous work. It is listed in no particular order at this moment. Thus, this page itself is a work in progress.

## Statistics Canada

### 2016 - Present

Work on a custom enterprise e-learning platform. This work includes new feature work, maintenance, and regression testing. In addition to platform maintenance, I create e-learning content using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for clients. Ensure that the work is WCAG accessible and language compliant.

Regular communications to keep client relations via emails, telephone, or in person. Moreover, I was given the opportunity to apply my software engineering chops in the research and development of platform modernization. This included requirements gathering, company outreach, and off-the-shelf enterprise software evaluation.

## IBM

### 2016

At IBM I was tasked with working on the Cognos Analytics product. During my stay at IBM, the product had no keyboard navigation. Thus, my biggest project included adding keyboard navigation for accessibility work across different browsers and environments. This included collaborating with the design team to ensure IBM's design look and feel. In addition, I did work on accessibility compliance and cross-browser responsiveness. Finally, typical work on bug fixes, unit testing, and regression testing.

I've also helped IBM @ Ottawa host hacking health initiative.
