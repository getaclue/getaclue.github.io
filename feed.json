            "content_text": "Over the years, I’ve tried many different approaches to managing my life and the tasks that I have to do. One thing is certain for me: keeping all the tasks in my head does not work long-term. Moreover, as I add more tasks, it becomes impossible to remember all the details of each task in my brain.This used to ding my confidence as I thought that I could keep everything in my head. I saw no need for a system or a process for my task management. I thought that a task management system is something that you use for work and not for personal success.I know about biases and that while it may be true that I am good at remembering my tasks, I can always experiment and get better.I haven’t found a perfect solution that is digital or analogue. I switch between the two or complement digital with analogue (and vice versa). Commonly, I have a notebook near my reach and using Notes app on my Mac and iPhone. Regardless of the medium that I use, I ALWAYS date my tasks.Recently, I had an experiment from March to May 2020 where I went back to using simple paper post-it notes and nothing else.Using the post-it notes system was a visual and physical process. I could use post-it’s colours to separate, categorize, or group ideas. Post-its allowed me to glue important tasks to my monitor for visibility. I could spread my post-it cards and view my ideas on any physical surface. I thought I found a perfect system and was feeling productive.These paper post-its were helpful in keeping my thoughts in line while I was writing my first book, Learn Node.js. I had an idea for the book but ideas for chapters and their structure were less clear.I had two post-it piles : to finish and finished. Every idea went into to finish pile. This pile would then grow and I would feel less anxious. In the individual post-it card, I was as descriptive as I could be about a task. The physical constraint of the post-it paper made sure that I was succinct. Then, as I progressed through my tasks I would cross out completed items and move them into the completed pile.Thus, I would reward myself twice:  (1) for completing a task by crossing it off and  (2) for placing a post-it card onto the completed pile and making the pile grow.Unfortunately, the post-it solution for tracking my life tasks died down around May 2020 when I completed my book. I could not get into the habit of using post-it notes for everything else in my life.Since then, I’ve been keeping important tasks in my head once again. I finally caught myself in this bad loop. I know that keeping things in my head for a long time leads to burnout. Now, I am trying to offload these things and get back into order. After post-its, I was using a combination of Apple Notes and physical paper for managing my global tasks.I think that post-it solution works great for short-term. It failed to captivate me in the long-term. Physical transport of the cards was a big let down. As my list of post-its grew, it became not realistic to carry the pile with me. While in transit, I found myself using the Notes app and not a post-it even if I had them with me. The paper can be lost, whereas my data in the app will stay there. This method fell short as I would fail to transfer data from the note’s app into its own post-it when I was at home. I did not like the need for double processing.What I want from my task management process is to see my progress and to keep track of tasks. I think the best way to approach this problem for me is to separate the year into 52 weeks and 12 months. Then for each week separate it into 7 days. Finally, for each day track the tasks added and completed. The following day, move tasks that were not completed from one day to the next. Group all this by months. Ideally this process is digital.I am trying Notion application to envision my described perfect task management process. I tried to use Trello before Notion but I could not reproduce the functionality. Notion made realizing my idea easier to do. I made my application look like this :To summarize, the system breakdown looks like :  [month #] &gt; [week #] &gt; [day #] &gt; [task(s)]Goals of system:  Streamline my productivity and increase positivity  Reduce daily stress and anxiety  Reduce reliance on my brain and offload data to an app  Use it for short-term and long-term task managementRules of system :  System depends on daily active use  In the morning, copy the data of previous day to the new day  Delete completed tasks from previous day  Go over the tasks in the To Do  Move tasks I think I will work on today to the top of the To Do list  Throughout the day, I add tasks as needed  Throughout the day, offload an idea from my head by creating it into a taskRisks :  If my to do list gets huge I can see myself being overwhelmed and stop using the system  Reliance on Notion  Not sure how to archive progress",

The aim of the book is to help developers, switching to javascript and node.js, to hit the ground running by building and uploading a functional project. By going through the book you will be able to build features that modern javascript applications require.My current plan is to self publish and I will be doing that using gumroad; then I will upload a copy on iBooks store; and checkout amazon’s self publishing via kindle. In all three scenarios, a pdf output of the book is perfect. So, the final version of my book will be available for purchase in at least the pdf format. Asciidoc documents are perfectly converted to pdf format using asciidoctor-pdf.I began writing my book using iBooks Author authoring tool with the intention of publishing the book on the iBooks store. However, as I progressed in my writing process, I realized that my book contained quite a bit of code blocks. I wrote about this earlier but I ended up fully re-doing my work and switching away from iBooks Author authoring tool.Quite honestly, lack of beautiful code blocks (once converted to pdf) is why I switched my writing into asciidoc format. For images, so far I have been fortunate to use a combination of screenshots and adobe photoshop software.For more involved diagrams, I opted out to use plantuml for diagram creation. It works pretty good and allows you to maintain your images in plain text format for backups or quick adjustments.I spent a few hours killing time by working on the book cover marketing material. I found https://www.freepik.com/ to have many wonderful book cover mockups for free. There are also paid alternatives. Point is… finding a beautiful cover may take some time =)To summarize:      write using asciidoc using vs code or asciidocfx        convert asciidoc to pdf using something like asciidoctor-pdf or asciidocfx        To publish the pdf book on gumroad one just needs to make an account.        To publish the pdf book to iBooks, one needs to connect your iCloud, in iTunes Connect, to Apple Books like so. And then you need to download iTunes Producer to upload your book to their store        To publish the pdf book to Amazon, one needs an amazon account and then head over to the kindle direct publishing  EDIT :  Turns out, to publish the pdf book on leanpub one just needs an account Oh yes, leanpub is another option if you would like to stick to markdown and not interested in learning the power of asciidoc.Happy writing!",

The goal of this book is to be viewed the best in the pdf format. As far as I could tell, iBooks Author, does a good job on doing what I want it to do. However, formatting the code blocks takes some time and it looks a bit odd on the pdf output. Well, to be honest it doesn’t look that great as an epub either.The way that I currently work is that I open vs code to the specific code file that I am talking about in the book and copy that code. When I switch to the iBooks Author I paste the copied code by right clicking in the section to be pasted and selecting “Paste and Retain Style” option.What this does is preserves the styles, font, and formatting of my code just like it was in vs code. This works well and would have no issues if I wanted my code in this book to look like regular text. I want the code blocks to stand out and be formatted differently. To do that I change the font background color and format each code block one line at a time.In the iBooks Author the formatting of the code blocks looks good :The issues arise when I export the project in any of the available formats. In the epub format and in the pdf the code block lines are processed with a small white border or spacing. Thus, the beautiful black background and the formatted code is viewed with white spacing in between each line. This makes the code blocks somewhat ugly and not exactly viewed how they are in the authoring tool. This is what the book looks like when opened in iBooks :and this is what a pdf output looks like :This week I found out about a different authoring tool, or I should say a different way of writing the book using asciidoc formatting language. The format is in plain text, which is awesome and requires no proprietary tool to create. However, it takes a little bit of time to get used to it. I spent two hours today redoing one of the sections of my book into asciidoc. I wanted to see if there was any difference in the pdf output of the code blocks. Moreover, I wanted to see what options I have for displaying code in general.To be honest, the pdf output looks pretty good and asciidoc format allows for nifty code annotations via numbers:Is it worth the switch for me at this point in time? No probably not. I am still focusing on the content so the formatting should come after the content. However, I will most likely convert the book from iBooks Author proprietary format to asciidoc.Apple’s authoring tool is wonderful if you are just working with text and media. Adding code blocks does not really work out of the box and requires some fiddling. Is it passable output for a selling product? I think so as I am selling content and not formatting. Formatting of the content is just icing on the cake for me. But, if I was starting this project again I would start it in the asciidoc format for sure. Plus I like having my content in just plain text and not stuck in some proprietary tool.If you are wondering I tried to use asciidocfx and vs code to code the section. VS code works well, but asciidocfx ‘s preview feature works a bit better. I thought that since asciidocfx is Java based that it would be slow to use and edit on, but so far so good. I’ll finish by showing what asciidocfx’s environment looks like :",

In the file I wrote the following:// config/db.jsconst Sequelize = require(\"sequelize\");const db = new Sequelize({  dialect: \"sqlite\",  storage: \"leappwriteup.sqlite3\",});module.exports = db;The configuration above basically follows the readme of the sequelize project. We are injecting the sequelize project, then we are instantiating a sequelize object that will use sqlite as its database. After this, I was ready to test the connections. All of the basic building blocks are there. The server, the database, and the connector. We test all three by running the following code in the index.js file (our start file) :// index.jsconst express = require(\"express\");const router = express.Router();const db = require(\"./config/db\");// start dbdb.authenticate()  .then((result) =&gt; {    console.log(\"Connection established.\");  })  .catch((error) =&gt; {    console.log(\"Unable to connect to db: \", error);  });// start appconst app = express();module.exports = app;In the code above we are first injecting the dependent packages : express and database, the code for which is from our text above. We then call the database to establish a connection. If everything works as expected I will see Connection established. message. Otherwise, I will see the error for why it did not connect to the db. Finally, the express server is started and the entire app is exported for use elsewhere in the code.node index.jsRun node index.js and see your progress. You should see the successful message. Congratulations, you have connected your server to the database and created an empty sqlite3 database file. Otherwise, review your steps or send me a shout ;)This part is totally optional. To interact with the database, we better start off with modeling our data as per sequelize documents. I did it by creating the following file in the folder models :mkdir modelscd models &amp;&amp; touch user.jsI then created the following code in the user.js file :// models/user.jsconst sequelize = require(\"../config/db\");const { DataTypes } = require(\"sequelize\");const User = sequelize.define(\"User\", {  email: {    type: DataTypes.STRING,    allowNull: false,  },  password: {    type: DataTypes.TEXT,    allowNull: false,  },  username: {    type: DataTypes.TEXT,    allowNull: false,  },  token: {    type: DataTypes.TEXT,    allowNull: false,  },});module.exports = User;Finally, test all of the code together by interacting with the database. I will do so by creating a seed file and running it.touch ../config/db.seed.jsIn the seed file I want to connect to the database and add one user to the database and save it. After doing that, I want to run my project again to ensure that the connection to the database is established.// config/db.seed.jsconst db = require(\"./db\");const User = require(\"../models/user\");const seed = async () =&gt; {  await db.sync({ force: true });  const password = `M&lt;gC4['Dqv}G''X\"Tg4XDbRrmWR46/ca`;  const username = \"getaclue\";  const email = \"info@getaclue.me\";  const token = `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxIiwibmFtZSI6ImluZm9AZ2V0YWNsdWUubWUiLCJpYXQiOjE1MTYyMzkwMjJ9.\\_lImbjluzsOJSy-hlDzEOasZRSd8YuQ_9hBmmCvSvp0`;  User.create({    password: password,    email: email,    username: username,    token: token,  })    .then((user) =&gt; {      console.log(\"seeded user\", user);      User.findOne({ where: { email: `${user.email}` } })        .then((user) =&gt; {          console.log(\"found in db after adding\");          db.close();        })        .catch((error) =&gt; {          console.error(\"error looking for new user in db: \", error);          db.close();        });    })    .catch((error) =&gt; {      console.error(\"failed to seed, \", error);      db.close();    });};seed();Once everything is typed out, you can feel free to test everything once again. I ran the follow commands and made sure everything worked as expected.node config/db.seed.jsnode index.jsHere is what your final folder structure should look like :I have installed Sequelize and SQLite in my ExpressJS project; established the connection between ExpressJS and SQLite via Sequelize; created User’s table, added some data, and queried that data.

My project was going to be simple : write a tutorial on authentication in nodejs apps. And I did complete the project, but I struggled to make it easy as possible to follow. I wrote this just so I could break down the next few entries. I ended up using a few packages that I absolutely couldn’t go without and that added to the scope. I also spent lots of time on research and seeing what is out there :I figured that a good post prior to me re-doing the project would be to talk about thinking of authentication. I will be breaking down the project into smaller parts. I figured in this post, I will outline what I am thinking about.AuthenticationBackground refresherFirst thing that I did when beginning the project was go to OWASP and remind myself of the common pitfalls in authentication, and password storage. After all, if I am putting a tutorial out there I want it to be somewhat secure.Links used in background refresher:  https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html  https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html  https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.htmlDecision timeI knew that I wanted to store the information in a database. I did not want to rely on a third party service. So, for data processing and database communication I opted for sequilize package. Sequilize is great in that you can switch databases and maintain data integrity because you describe all of your data in code in one place.For this tutorial, I wanted to store username, email, and password. I did not want to store the password as plaintext for this tutorial even though I was trying to keep the tutorial simple. My goto solution for password encryption is usually the bcrypt algorithm. So, for this project, naturally, I decided to use the bcrypt package.I couldn’t decide if I wanted to teach about jwt tokens or session cookies. Afterall, nowadays you need to be comfortable in both. So, I opted out for storing jwt token in the cookies. Using cookies is usually my default go-to because the technology is proven, safe, and reliable. Cookies have been here since the beginning on web apps.However, as I proceeded through my project, I realized that this went beyond the scope of my initial tutorial. This added a level of authorization to our authentication tutorial. I finished this authorization not realizing that I will have to backtrack in my actual write up and create several tutorials out of it.How to connect Sequilize to ExpressJS appThis tutorial will talk about the setup of sequilize and a simple model of our user that will be used in follow up tutorials. The user will contain username, password, and email attributes. Maybe… I will add token attribute and confirmation_token attributes for confirmation steps. Haven’t fully decided on this.How to add authentication to ExpressJS app with SequilizeFor the sake of my tutorial authentication will be split into : user sign up, user login, and user password reset. I will have to mention about bcrypt.How to add authorization to ExpressJS app with SequilizeFor this tutorial I will be mentioning the usage of jwt and session cookies. These details kind of depend on the clients that will be using our API and whether or not we have an API. I used both to show the different ways of implementing authorization. Personally I prefer cookies as they have been battle tested in various environments, but sometimes for things like mobile apps, you need to use something like jwt. I simply saved my generated jwt token in our cookies so that we can play with both :)Here is what it looked like when finished :I am not sure if I will have this UI for the written up tutorials or if I will come up with something else.PS: When most people think of authentication they actually are referring to authorization. So… you may have to explain this to your client. It is a good idea to have a walk through of the components that you need to build. You can create deliverables out of them.The example above shows the authorization and authentication of a simple user profile using jwt and cookies. The information is stored in a sqlite3 database in the local directory and is using sequilize driver for data access. The ui is build using tailwindcss (I have a tutorial on that tailwindcss which you can visit here). With the help of jwt our software is also ready to create an api for mobile or desktop clients if there was ever a need.I was not tracking my time on this but it says I used about 3 hours this weekend in VS Code. Which includes writing in VS Code as well. So maybe divide in half? About 1 hour or 1.5 hours on this code for sure I would think.links that I may or may not have used (ie tabs open at the time of writing this article):  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link  link",

The user will contain username, password, and email attributes. Maybe… I will add token attribute and confirmation_token attributes for confirmation steps. Haven’t fully decided on this.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-add-authentication-to-expressjs-app-with-sequilize\">How to add authentication to ExpressJS app with Sequilize</h3><p>For the sake of my tutorial authentication will be split into : user sign up, user login, and user password reset. I will have to mention about <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt\">bcrypt</a>.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-add-authorization-to-expressjs-app-with-sequilize\">How to add authorization to ExpressJS app with Sequilize</h3><p>For this tutorial I will be mentioning the usage of <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken\">jwt</a> and session <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cookie-parser.html\">cookies</a>. These details kind of depend on the clients that will be using our API and whether or not we have an API. I used both to show the different ways of implementing authorization. Personally I prefer cookies as they have been battle tested in various environments, but sometimes for things like mobile apps, you need to use something like <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken\">jwt</a>. I simply saved my generated <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken\">jwt</a> token in our <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cookie-parser.html\">cookies</a> so that we can play with both :)</p><p>Here is what it looked like when finished :</p><p><img src=\"/assets/images/2020-03-16/sign_in.png\" alt=\"sign in\" style=\"max-width:100%\" /><img src=\"/assets/images/2020-03-16/sign_up.png\" alt=\"sign up\" style=\"max-width:100%\" /><img src=\"/assets/images/2020-03-16/forgot_password.png\" alt=\"forgot password\" style=\"max-width:100%\" /><img src=\"/assets/images/2020-03-16/profile.png\" alt=\"profile\" style=\"max-width:100%\" /></p><p>I am not sure if I will have this UI for the written up tutorials or if I will come up with something else.</p><hr /><p>PS: When most people think of authentication they actually are referring to authorization. So… you may have to explain this to your client. It is a good idea to have a walk through of the components that you need to build. You can create deliverables out of them.</p><p>The example above shows the authorization and authentication of a simple user profile using <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken\">jwt</a> and <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cookie-parser.html\">cookies</a>. The information is stored in a sqlite3 database in the local directory and is using <a href=\"https://sequelize.org\">sequilize</a> driver for data access. The ui is build using <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">tailwindcss</a> (I have a tutorial on that tailwindcss which you can visit <a href=\"https://getaclue.me/2020/03/13/javascript-nodejs-express-tailwind\">here</a>). With the help of <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken\">jwt</a> our software is also ready to create an api for mobile or desktop clients if there was ever a need.</p><p>I was not tracking my time on this but it says I used about 3 hours this weekend in VS Code. Which includes writing in VS Code as well. So maybe divide in half? About 1 hour or 1.5 hours on this code for sure I would think.</p><p>links that I may or may not have used (ie tabs open at the time of writing this article):</p><ul>  <li><a

Personally, I do not happen to care very much for Ruby. It looks the same as Python and even is written using similar syntax and notation. However, it just so happens that ruby on rails was built using Ruby. It provided quick way to create projects while being the talk of everyone. The most productive framework if you may. Part of the fun was that everyone was creating using it. As a result, you could find people using ruby on rails in many places and you feel a sense of community without being in one.Among the fun experience, ruby on rails also provided various tools and features that came out of the box. This would cut down the development time extremely short and increase developer productivity. However, as the time went on and the framework stabilized, the craze died down and trend moved elsewhere. People and companies stopped using ruby on rails and moved on to JavaScript or other languages and frameworks. That is the purpose of trends, to move to the next one… not all of them moved because of trends … I know.It makes sense that ruby on rails was the king for a while. JavaScript (among other frameworks and languages) was not where it is in 2020 and Nodejs was not even a thing. Let alone having LTS releases of Nodejs that enterprise could use and rely on.Now, I am talking from MY experience and my day-to-day programming. Or should I say ranting about my experience with ruby on rails.The biggest negative I found, while working on rails, is that the systems usually turn into spaghetti code. I’ve seen this happen time after time first hand. This type of environment is definitely not fun to untangle or add features to. It becomes work minus the fun. Second, rails is fairly resource intensive and for a good reason – it comes with a lot of utility out of the box. Third, making rails fast is possible but requires some rolling up of the sleeves and jumping into the framework specific adjustments. Fourth, and this one is kind of my pet peeve … having ruby on rails work differently from its intension, from convention over configuration, is a headache. Moreover, you should be familiar with enough of the framework as to not damage other parts that you may be modifying.Don’t get me wrong, ruby on rails is still my goto for starting new projects but it is not as fun as it used to be. I want to be working on problems not debating if I should ditch ruby on rails for something else. I do wonder if it is laziness at this point or familiarity that is preventing me from jumping ruby ship. There is far less people using it and far less excitement talking to other programmers using the framework. It is harder to find like minded people. It seems that DHH from Basecamp is the only one that is still spearheading how awesome and relevant ruby on rails is. It is his investment after all.Sure you can have any of these problems in any other language or framework. And sure, my problems listed above can be fixed by refactoring, reading the documents, staying with the convention, and just doing the work. When you start fixing the problems, it becomes additional work that someone has to do that is hard to sell to a manager. All of this to say, is that it removes the fun for me.I’ve been thinking this for some time now and wanted to put it in words and archive it.

Plus it looks super cool and official. Now that I’ve done it, I want to document the tl;dr of the process for myself and share with you along the way. I wish I would have done this sooner because it is really EASY to do.  I’ve had email catchers before but I’ve never had the opportunity to send emails from my own domain. Plus, I’ve been looking at trying out new tools for my email anyway. I’ve been with google’s email service since its inception.

            "content_text": "From Object Oriented JavaScript (Part the First)var literalDog = {        // declaration AND instantiation    name: \"Vincent\",      // object property    speak: function() {   // object method        return this.name + \" says woof\";    }};literalDog.speak();  // \"Vincent says woof\"  Inside of the speak method the this variable will refer to the current context of the function execution. This is an important distinction with classically object oriented languages: the value of this can (and often does) change! In most cases, this inside of a method like the one above will refer to the current object or instance. Without some other influence, if a method is called with “dot” syntax as in the last line above, then you can generally expect this inside the function to be whatever is on the left side of the dot. Inside of literalDog.speak() the this variable will refer to the object left of the dot: literalDog.function Dog(name) {    if (name) { this.name = name; }    this.speak = function() {        return this.name + \" says woof\";    }}var v = new Dog(\"Vincent\");  First of all, the use of the capitol “D” in Dog is only done by convention, this is not a requirement of the language.which obviously leads to  … any function in JavaScript can be used as a “constructor” …So, naturally  If Dog is just a regular function, why don’t we just call it normally? Why do we need to use the new keyword?Yeah man, why?  To answer that, we have to understand that every function in JavaScript has a concept of a prototype; which is, generally speaking, a representation of what the newly created instance should be.So, a function is an object. An object that uses this prototype concept to define itself. As a result, when we are calling the new reserved keyword, what happens is three of the following things.  Create an empty object;  set the new object’s prototype to point to the prototype;  and call the constructor method on the new object.  The reason for illustrating what the new keyword is doing is to highlight that it is not the same as classically inherited languages. In JavaScript, new is syntactic sugar and nothing else.I am not sure why but I really liked this explanation. JavaScript has a lot of interesting concepts that you don’t really need to master in order for everything to work.I went ahead with his examplefunction Dog(name){if (name) { this.name = name; }this.speak = function() {return this.name + \" says woof\";}}and then I used it the regular way that I am used tovar doggo = new Dog(\"Thunder\");doggo.speak();&gt; \"Thunder says woof\"but I also implemented it the new way. I am not used to creating objects this way, but it adds to my javascript knowledge for surevar otherDoggo = Object.create(Dog.prototype); // step 1 and step 2otherDoggo.constructor(\"Thunder\"); // step 3otherDoggo.speak();&gt; \"Thunder says woof\"To be honest with you, I would prefer to use it this way just because it allows me to context switch between other concepts and javascript way faster. Seeing the new keyword almost automatically makes me think in a wrong way.To which the author of the article made a note  There are some people in the JavaScript community who feel that syntactic sugar like the new keyword does more harm than good and choose not to use it at all. However, with ECMAScript 6 (ES6) pushing for more syntactic sugar surrounding OOP, it is unlikely that it will lose favor on a wider scale.and that is so. People prefer to write shorter syntax but I believe it makes learning such a weird language a bit more challenging. Which is fine.A side issue — which is prevelant everywhere in software — nobody goes back and fixes all of the old tutorials. As a result JavaScript evolves but the answers you get when you search on google or stackoverflow can be from any date.What if you are following some JavaScript tutorial and trying to understand some concepts. None of the tutorials ever state that JavaScript implementation is browser specific and environment specific. Yes … the various vendors are finally becoming similar but there are small differences. Afterall, the vendors are simply implementing ECMAScript.You still see these differences in 2018. For example, if I go back to the same article as I linked above, the text expects you to see something like&gt; console.log(Dog.prototype);{    constructor: Dog(name) {        if (name) { this.name = name; }    },    name: \"Bubbles\",    speak: function() {        return this.name + \" says woof\";    },    __proto__: Object { ... }}but what you see in most up-to-date firefox iswhereas in chrome you seeso my strategy my dear friend would be to understand the fundamentals. This way, you can adjust the syntax based on your environment. Unfortunately this will be so until all vendors catch up (if ever). Looking back on the past few years — I trully believed we would have it standardized by now.Another thing, if you read the previous essay, that I wanted to improve my understanding in was the indirect invocation belowfunction Runner(name) {  console.log(this instanceof Rabbit); // =&gt; true  this.name = name;}function Rabbit(name, countLegs) {  console.log(this instanceof Rabbit); // =&gt; true  // Indirect invocation. Call parent constructor.  Runner.call(this, name);  this.countLegs = countLegs;}var myRabbit = new Rabbit('White Rabbit', 4);myRabbit; // { name: 'White Rabbit', countLegs: 4 }specificallyRunner.call(this, name);Today I seem to have discovered that answer from the same article  The parent method will not be automatically called for you!  The trick is that we can’t simply call Animal() directly because the context inside that function will not be correct. Calling a function like that would typically set this inside the function to point to the window object, our default context.and if you recall JavaScript has several ways to invoke functions. It is important to understand because this is set during invocation. Thus, that is exactly how this type of function invocation in JavaScript works.  … Instead, we have to manually call the Animal constructor function while changing its context to point to our new Dog instance.function Animal(age) {    if (age) { this.age = age; }    var alive = true;    this.isAlive = function() { return alive; }    this.die = function() { alive = false; }}Animal.prototype.age = 1;function Dog(name) {    if (name) { this.name = name; }}function Animal(age) { /* ... */ }Animal.prototype.age = 1;function Dog(name) { /* ... */ }Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;Dog.prototype.name = \"Bubbles\";// The remainder of Dog.prototype members...var v = new Dog(\"Vincent\");  The key to understanding this relationship is understanding that the prototype object is a fall back mechanism.  [i]f the current instance object (v) does not have an age property directly on it JavaScript will “fall back” to the first prototype (Dog.prototype) and look for age there. If that object doesn’t have an age property, JavaScript will “fall back” to the next prototype, in this case Animal.prototype (defined by the __proto__ member of Dog.prototype). There it is! JavaScript found a member called age on the Animal.prototype and will use that value.  This structure is referred to as the prototype chain and falling back to successive prototypes is the mechanism by which JavaScript creates inheritance.Polymorphism  But this is not exactly polymorphism since the two functions do not share a name or form (different method signatures). To show how JavaScript supports this concept we need another example.  Notice how the Animal object has an age property. This is great, but perhaps we want the age to always be represented in “human years” (which we’ll assume is the default).SoAnimal.prototype.getAge = function() { return this.age; }and consequentlyDog.prototype.getAge = function() {    var dogYears = Animal.prototype.getAge.apply(this);    return (dogYears * 7);}Thus both Dog and Animal have getAge() but the functionality is a bit different. I’ll let the author explain as they do a good job  There are a couple things to note in the example above. First, we must use the method as it is defined on the Animal.prototype in order to call the parent method. If we try to simply call this.getAge() JavaScript will think we want the Dog.prototype.getAge method and we’ll enter a recursive, infinite loop! Second, we have to use the apply method of the getAge function object in order to switch the context again. Remember, if we were to simply call the method as is (Animal.prototype.getAge()) then the context will be the object on the left side of the dot: Animal.prototype. It will not be our Dog instance!  Once we have retrieved the stored age value, we can simply return that value multiplied by 7. In this manner we are able to achieve polymorphism by having a method with the same name and same function signature, but with different implementations depending on the type of object (Animal versus Dog versus Cat).While we are able to write code that looks something likeclass Dog extends Animal {  constructor(name, age) {    super(age);  // Call parent method of the same name    if (name) { this._name = name; }  }  get name() {    return this._name + \" (the dog)\";  }  set name(value) {    this._name = value.toLowerCase();  }  speak() {    return this.name + \" says woof\";  }}It is nice to know the prototypical background of the language. It is the foundation of the language and how it fundamentally  works. This way it does not matter which abstractions are built on top — you simply adjust =)I had a lot of issues learning JavaScript as I was coming from a typical accredited computer science background. JavaScript is this frankenstein of a language that dominates the present software terrain. However, the varied implementation by vendors is less than ideal for its stability to teach new staff and overall well being of the language. I wish there was a better management of outdated information. JavaScript is constantly changing so I am not sure if this is possible in this never ending race.Reminds me of the issues that people had surrounding learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails: the various syntactic magic that goes behind the scenes. I don’t think all of this magic is an issue in JavaScript environment for one big reason — JavaScript is free and all you need is a browser. Nobody to pay any fees; nothing to install; do not need to pay for an IDE. Plus, you get to take all of the invested development hours and use it for free.Can’t say the same for Ruby on Rails or any other language or framework.See you next time",

If that object doesn’t have an age property, JavaScript will “fall back” to the next prototype, in this case Animal.prototype (defined by the __proto__ member of Dog.prototype). There it is! JavaScript found a member called age on the Animal.prototype and will use that value.</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>This structure is referred to as the prototype chain and falling back to successive prototypes <strong>is the mechanism by which JavaScript creates inheritance</strong>.</p></blockquote><hr /><h2 id=\"polymorphism\">Polymorphism</h2><blockquote>  <p>But this is not exactly polymorphism since the two functions do not share a name or form (different method signatures). To show how JavaScript supports this concept we need another example.</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>Notice how the Animal object has an age property.

I’ll let the author explain as they do a good job</p><blockquote>  <p>There are a couple things to note in the example above. First, we must use the method as it is defined on the Animal.prototype in order to call the parent method. If we try to simply call this.getAge() JavaScript will think we want the Dog.prototype.getAge method and we’ll enter a recursive, infinite loop! Second, we have to use the apply method of the getAge function object in order to switch the context again. Remember, if we were to simply call the method as is (Animal.prototype.getAge()) then the context will be the object on the left side of the dot: Animal.prototype. It will not be our Dog instance!</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>Once we have retrieved the stored age value, we can simply return that value multiplied by 7. In this manner <strong>we are able to achieve polymorphism</strong> by having a method with the same name and same function signature, but with different implementations depending on the type of object (Animal versus Dog versus Cat).</p></blockquote><p>While we are able to write code that looks something like</p><div class=\"language-javascript highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">class</span> <span class=\"nx\">Dog</span> <span class=\"kd\">extends</span> <span class=\"nx\">Animal</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>  <span class=\"kd\">constructor</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">name</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">age</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>    <span class=\"k\">super</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">age</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>  <span class=\"c1\">// Call parent method of the same name</span>    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">name</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"k\">this</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">_name</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">name</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"p\">}</span>  <span class=\"p\">}</span>  <span class=\"kd\">get</span> <span class=\"nx\">name</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"k\">this</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">_name</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\"> (the dog)</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>  <span class=\"p\">}</span>  <span class=\"kd\">set</span> <span class=\"nx\">name</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">value</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>    <span class=\"k\">this</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">_name</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">value</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">toLowerCase</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>  <span class=\"p\">}</span>  <span class=\"nx\">speak</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"k\">this</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">name</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\"> says woof</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>  <span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"p\">}</span></code></pre></div></div><hr /><p>It is nice to know the prototypical background of the language. It is the foundation of the language and how it fundamentally  works.

JavaScript is this frankenstein of a language that dominates the present software terrain. However, the varied implementation by vendors is less than ideal for its stability to teach new staff and overall well being of the language. I wish there was a better management of outdated information. JavaScript is constantly changing so I am not sure if this is possible in this never ending race.</p><p>Reminds me of the issues that people had surrounding learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails: the various syntactic magic that goes behind the scenes. I don’t think all of this magic is an issue in JavaScript environment for one big reason — JavaScript is free and all you need is a browser. Nobody to pay any fees; nothing to install; do not need to pay for an IDE.

            "content_text": "After writing this essay a few days ago, I could not stop thinking of figuring out where exactly my error is. Like I mentioned before, I understand the subject matter but not as deep as I would like to.So, I began by looking backwards: I wanted to figure out during which course I was introduced to them first. I knew that it was around first or second year; and I knew that it was in Calculus. I did not remember if it was Calculus I or Calculus II. I could not remember but why struggle when you can look this up? Since my degree is from an accredited institution that provides accredited degrees — I can simply request this information or look it up. All of the courses and their description is fully published at uOttawa so this took me a few minutes.Turns out it was first introduced to me during Calculus II. While I didn’t have my notes, I did recall which textbook I used to study and I recall exactly where we studied this. I did have the textbook so I just went ahead and looked it up. And then everything clicked in for me — I figured out how I got confused around series and sequences.It was precisely in Chapter 8 of this (not) so wonderful textbook by James Stewart. Why do I say not so wonderful? Because, looking on the order of topics presented in retrospect, sequences, series, and limits of these things were introduced at the same time. What I did not realize when I was younger — professors usually follow a textbook for their instructions. So, if the textbook does not match your studying techniques then the way the knowledge is delivered via professor will not aid.Sequence is introduced as:  A sequence can be thought of as a list of numbers written in a definite order …Ok good I can follow that. One thing that should have been bolded, in my opinion, was the definite order part of the definition but it was not. Right after the definition, we were shown three ways of describing a sequence:  … one by using the preceding notation, another by using the defining formula, and a third by writing out the terms of the sequence …Ok, even though I’ve never seen this before presented like this I can follow along. Then they moved to describing how you could find such a description on your own via an example:  … [n]otice that the numerators of these fractions start with 3 and increase by 1 whenever we go to the next term. The second term has numerator 4, the third term has numerator 5; in general, the nth term will have numerator n + 2. The denominators are the powers of 5,  … so an has denominator 5n. The signs of the terms are alternately positive and negative, so we need to multiply by a power of 1. In Example 1(b) the factor …  meant we started with a negative term. Here we want to start with a positive term and so we use …Looking at it now — there is a lot going on above and definitely went above my head when I was introduced OR I did not understand it. But that was not the culprit — you can get by just fine with not understanding this.On the same page we get some new examples of sequences that is introduced as  … sequences that don’t have simple defining equationsBoom. Problem 1 — sequences don’t have simple defining equations. That is such a subtle and non-bolded way of describing an important property of sequences. But don’t worry, as you keep reading this example, one sub-example at a time, you come to the famous Fibonacci sequence that everyone loves to introduce.And how do they introduce this example? Using limits ofcourse. This is calculus afterall. This was Problem 2 for my understanding. These two problems are the reasons where everything went downhill. The text went on to the properties such as convergence and divergence and others. Nowhere, was there a connection of some sort to series.This is what I meanAnd how was a series introduced?  What do we mean when we express a number as an infinite decimal? For instance, what does it mean to write…  … The convention behind our decimal notation is that any number can be written as an infinite sum. Here it means that…  … where the three dots … indicate that the sum continues forever, and the more terms we add, the closer we get to the actual value of pi.Does it make sense to you if you were seeing this for the first time? It did not for me. If you keeping reading there is a mention of a connection between a sequence and a serience  … Thus the sum of a series is the limit of the sequence of partial sums. …so I cannot say that the author did not connect the ideas. But I can say that it was not clear for me then. When you combine the idea that the textbook was not helpful, the speed at which education moves, and a teacher that follows the book without helping you — you move on and keep going. Obviously I adapted and learned, otherwise I would not have graduated magna cum laude.This whole thing was pretty surreal for me and super exciting. Not only did I narrow down my confusion surrounding sequences and series but I also uncovered the exact point where I got confused. Anywho, I’m going to continue studying my weak areas so that I can improve my analysis of algorithms. I think that I am pretty good but I want to be better.Originally I was going to write about something else but this experience was more exciting for today.

But that was not the culprit — you can get by just fine with not understanding this.</p><p>On the same page we get some new examples of sequences that is introduced as</p><blockquote>  <p>… sequences that don’t have simple defining equations</p></blockquote><p>Boom. Problem 1 — sequences don’t have simple defining equations. That is such a subtle and non-bolded way of describing an important property of sequences. But don’t worry, as you keep reading this example, one sub-example at a time, you come to the famous Fibonacci sequence that everyone loves to introduce.</p><p>And how do they introduce this example? Using limits ofcourse. This is calculus afterall. This was Problem 2 for my understanding. These two problems are the reasons where everything went downhill. The text went on to the properties such as convergence and divergence and others. Nowhere, was there a connection of some sort to series.</p><p>This is what I mean</p><p><img src=\"/assets/images/2018-10-16/fibonacci-sequence-introduction.png\" alt=\"Fibonacci sequence\" /></p><p>And how was a series introduced?</p><blockquote>  <p>What do we mean when we express a number as an infinite decimal? For instance, what does it mean to write…</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>… The convention behind our decimal notation is that any number can be written as an infinite sum. Here it means that…</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>… where the three dots … indicate that the sum continues forever, and the more terms we add, the closer we get to the actual value of pi.</p></blockquote><p>Does it make sense to you if you were seeing this for the first time? It did not for me. If you keeping reading there <em>is</em> a mention of a connection between a sequence and a serience</p><blockquote>  <p>… Thus the sum of a series is the limit of the sequence of partial sums. …</p></blockquote><p>so I cannot say that the author did not connect the ideas. But I can say that it was not clear for me then. When you combine the idea that the textbook was not helpful, the speed at which education moves, and a teacher that follows the book without helping you — you move on and keep going. Obviously I adapted and learned, otherwise I would not have graduated magna cum laude.</p><p>This whole thing was pretty surreal for me and super exciting. Not only did I narrow down my confusion surrounding sequences and series but I also uncovered the exact point where I got confused. Anywho, I’m going to continue studying my weak areas so that I can improve my analysis of algorithms. I think that I am pretty good but I want to be better.</p><p>Originally I was going to write about something else but this experience was more exciting for today. Here are some links that I was going to talk about (I still want to talk about them in the future at some point)</p><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18227768\">To become a software consultant, avoid letting clients pay you for code (2017) (daedtech.com)</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/\">Don’t Call Yourself A Programmer, And Other Career Advice</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14942561\">Ask HN: Web developer and looking for a career change, what are my options?</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/stephen-hawking-book-launch-1.4863459\">Science, education ‘in danger now more than ever,’ Hawking says posthumously</a></li></ul><p>and from the Hawkings article I highlighted</p><blockquote>  <p>“Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist,” he said. “It matters that you don’t give up.

When you are approximating, when do you add the runtimes and when do you multiply them?  if do this, then when you are done with this, do that, then you add runtimes  if do this for each time you do that, then you multiply runtimesThe Insertion-Sort AlgorithmThe goal of this algorithm is simple: take an array of elements and sort it in an increasing order. It does so by inserting one element at a time and by comparing elements during insertion.  Algorithm InsertionSort(A):  Input: An array A of n comparable elements  Output: The array A with elements rearranged in nondecreasing orderWe basically walk one element at a time, from 0 to n:  for k from 1 to n do  Insert element A[k] at its proper location in the array at position A[0], A[1], A[2], …, A[k]or as you would like to call it — increasing order.Question: When will this algorithm behave the best?Answer: When the elements in the array are sorted in order.Question: When will this algorithm have the worst of times?Answer: When the elements in the array are placed in the reversed order (from high to low - a decreasing order). Our little guy will have to swap every element and move it to the other side.Guided with the following from textbook  using an outer loop to consider each element in turn,and an inner loop that moves a newly considered element to its proper location relative to the (sorted) subarray of elements that are to its leftI went on to do my own implementation — because why not and I could use some review.public static char[] insertionSort(char[] input) {        if (input.length == 0) {            return input;        }        /*        Assumption: position 0 is sorted by definition        Start with position 1            Grab the value at the position                Question: is the value at previous position 0 (n-1) bigger than current value                    if yes                        do a loop                            place previous value that is bigger in the current place                    if no                        do no loop               Place the current value in the position based on the answer to the question         */        for (int i = 1; i &lt; input.length; i++) {            char current = input[i];            int insertPosition = i;            /*                We are walking from the current position to the front of the array at position 0             */            for (; insertPosition &gt; 0; ) {                if (input[insertPosition - 1] &gt; current) {                    input[insertPosition] = input[insertPosition - 1];                    insertPosition--;                } else {                    break;                }            }            input[insertPosition] = current;        }        return input;    }See you tomorrow.",

            "content_text": "Today I ended up exploring a topic that I didn’t expect: what is the difference between a sequence and a series.While I memorized these contepts in my calculus days, I always felt something was missing in my core understanding. I think I figured out what was missing. It seems that I was confused, once again, around the ambiguity of the English language.I stumbled upon the following in one of my favourite textbooks:  A numeric progression is a sequence of numbers, where each number depends on one or more of the previous numbers.followed by  arithmetic progression determines the next number by adding a fixed constant to the previous valueand  geometric progression determines the next number by multiplying the previous value by a fixed constantwhich made me go Aha. All I had to do was check if the thing was made by adding or by multiplying? Seems easy enough to get.I’m sure I had the same thoughts back in school. So, I decided to play around and see what I find confusing so I could fix my gaps in knowledge. I thought: hmm, they are using both terms, a progression and sequence, in one sentence. Confused — because if you don’t really pay attention then you could interpret these two terms as having a similar meaning.What I should have considered was the specific word choice in math. Similar confusions were found in other areas. For example, different terminology in the graph space. One positive thing that I did notice is that specialty books are beginning to mention discrepancies surrounding word choice.Getting back to progression and sequence confusion. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that I had confusion back in the day. Confusion around terminology and not the concepts. If you read one of the previous entries, then you recall me saying that pattern matching works to a certain degree. So, I used pattern matching during my former student days. It got me far enough but I was never satisfied.Unlike my former student self, I have the leisure and time to explore this further.I found the following excerpt on quora from how does sequence and progression differ?  … all progressions are sequences, all sequences are not progression …OK, so that brought my understanding a bit closer. So a sequence is a collection of things. Hmm, but that sounds very close to what a set is. So, what is the difference between a sequence and a set? Is there one? Decided to consult wonderful wikipedia definition for more information.So a sequence is like a set because they are a collection that contains things: members or elements. Like a set, this collection can be finite or infinite. Ok… so still not too clear so far. However, as we read further — what we find, is that in a sequence, unlike in a set, repeated occurences of members are allowed. Additionally, unlike in a set, the order of individual members in the collection matters.Furthermore, a sequence does not have to be only denoted by [an explicit] formula. A sequence can also be denoted by a logical statement:  A sequence may be denoted by an explicit formula, like Tn = 2 + n, or it may be denoted by a logical statement like Tn = nth prime number. It is not necessary that a set of numbers be arranged according to an explicit formula in order for it to be called a ‘sequence’; it can also be arranged according to some logical statement that does not have an explicit mathematical formula but is nonetheless mathematically logical in order for it to be called a sequence.So, the definition of a sequence and how it differs from a set is starting to make sense. How does a progression relate to all of this? Well, a numeric progression is a sequence of numbers where each element depends on one or more of the previous members.Just like in the quote above from the textbook, it follows that there are at least two such relationships:  a relationship between two members such that the difference between these two members is a constant — this is called an arithmetic progression or arithmetic sequence.  a relationship between two members such that the quotient of any two successive members of the sequence is a constant — this is called a geometric progression or a geometric sequence.Or said it another way (from the same textbook as mentioned):  geometric progression, in which each value is produced by multiplying the preceding value by a fixed constant, known as the base of the geometric progression.We have looked at a set, sequence, and a progression so far. How do these things relate to a series? Very simple — a series is just the summation of all of the elements in the sequence. So, it then follows, what is the sum of the elements in a given sequence represented by? A series. Just like that. It finally makes sense how a series and a sequence are related. Nothing complicated. No new formulas. Just the proper definitions presented in a familiar way.Moreover, the total sum of the sequence can be broken up into partial sum(s) — a sum from element ai to element an. What is interesting about this? Well the fact that (p)artial sums, themselves, form a sequence.Well, there you have it.See you tomorrow.",

So the parser simply interpreted the code about as any regular code. You need to add raw and endraw tags before the code and proceed as before!

Had some hiccups with looking up regular expressions syntax in Java.

I expected [^w] to match to all characters that are not words and [^s] to match all characters that are not spaces.          String sanitizedString = inputWSReplaced.replaceAll(\"[^\\\\w\\\\s]\", \"\");        Similar to how I would do it in JavaScript    \"Some Str,in'g?\"  .toLowerCase()  .replace(/[^\\w\\s]/g, '')  .replace(/ /g, '-');        I also changed the about page and the projects page      I added a new template for the about and projects pages    Modified the way images are displayed in the liquid templates.

There’s another reason why data structure and algorithm knowledge comes up: because it’s hard to ask problem-solving questions that don’t involve them. It turns out that the vast majority of problem-solving questions involve some of these basics. When enough candidates know these basics, easy to get into a pattern of asking questions with them.This quote talks about justifications of asking data structure and algorithm questions. It finishes off with some practical reasoning for this interview structure. You, as an applicant have to remember this. These scenarios are easy to create, modify, and repeat. Additionally, it could save immediate and future employee costs.  Not only might you be judged harshly for not really understanding big 0, but you will also struggle to judge when your algorithm is getting faster or slower.This quote was in the context of Big O. I’ve personally experienced this in a group setting. It wasn’t during an interview per se but I’ve definitely been caught off guard by this. Some people say maybe you shouldn’t meet your heroes. Maybe that is true. I’ll let you be your own judge of that. In this case, the harsh judgement came from a well known and important person.

Big O time is the language and metric we use to describe the efficiency of algorithms. Not understanding it thoroughly can really hurt you in developing an algorithm.

So, I figured I should give it a shot and I even had an idea to implement.Problem StatementEvery time I write this piece of content, I have to name this file. I have a specific way I name these files: It goes date-title.markdown so it is easier for me to reference in the future. When the parser does its magic, it also creates a nice, seo friendly URL that I can share. It gives some context to readers that are reading it right now in October 2018. If you look at the link, you know that it is a fresh article without even reading it ;-) People like me like to read things like this. While it is fine to do it manually once in a while, it became too repetative to me. SPM to the rescue!IdeaMake a cli tool using SPM that can:  take input from cli  input like : $ tool \"Swift package manager october 2018\"  and provide output to me so I can copy/paste while I am creating a new file… oh and I get to write something today ;-)SolutionHere is my code:// main.swiftimport Foundationprivate let arguments: [String] = CommandLine.arguments//guard arguments.count &gt; 1, !arguments[1].isEmpty else {    print(\"Need some kind of arguments fam\")    exit(EXIT_FAILURE)}//let input = \"Will end-user applications ever be truly programmable?\"let input = arguments[1]let inputLowerCased = input.lowercased()//print(input)func dashifyText(_ inputTxt:String?) -&gt; String {    guard let input = inputTxt, !input.isEmpty else {        return \"\"    }    var result = \"\"    for character in input {        if (character == \" \") {            result = result + \"-\"        } else if(character == \"?\") {            result = result + \"\"        } else {            result = result + String(character)        }    }    return result}let currDateTime = Date()let dateFormatter = DateFormatter()// For example, short would have the basics: \"10/8/16, 10:52 PM\"dateFormatter.timeStyle = .shortdateFormatter.dateStyle = .shortlet currDateTimeText = dateFormatter.string(from: currDateTime)func dashifyDateTimeString(_ forString:String?) -&gt; String {    guard let dateTimeString = forString else {        return \"\"    }    var resultant = \"\"    for char in dateTimeString {        switch char {        case \"/\":            resultant = resultant + \"-\"        case \",\":            resultant = resultant + \"\"        case \":\":            resultant = resultant + \"-\"        case \" \":            resultant = resultant + \"-\"        default:            resultant = resultant + String(char)        }    }    return resultant}let dashifiedText = dashifyText(inputLowerCased)let dateTimeText = dashifyDateTimeString(currDateTimeText)let finalString = \"\\(dateTimeText)-\\(dashifiedText).markdown\"print(finalString)print(\"LENGTH: \\(finalString.count)\")and in the process, I’ve tried different things.

A list that I curate and maintain manually — a practice that everyone prior to SAAS explosion used to be intimately familiar with: using bookmarks.Why am I going back to doing this? I jumped in just like everyone else on the social media train that started moving in the early 2000s.As this train moved further away from the station, I noticed that I changed the way I interacted with information. Instead of saving things locally on my computer, I would off-load it to the cloud. At first, it made it very convenient for myself: I wouldn’t need to worry about hard-drive crashes or lost information. Even then — a failing hard-drive almost never crossed my mind during my day-to-day uses even if I was mindful of its risk. I finally knew where I could find anything. No more plugging in different hard drives and searching for my things. (and storage capacities at prices that I could not afford previously).Eventually, the technology improved and added things I did not know I was missing. Specifically — the sharing and collaborating features. The cloud ecosystems enabled the possibility of sharing interesting information with others. Most importantly, it allowed for asynchronous (and real-time) working experience with others and paved the remote work movement. In other words, saving things locally was a thing of the past. Archaic. Everything. Always. Stayed somewhere else.Problems? What problems? All of our problems went away we were told by marketers. Previously, if I shared information with someone there were many variables involved in the process: from compressing, to transfer, to uptime, and so on. Now, there were no more problems. If you cannot get my shared documents then something is wrong on your end; with the way you are doing things. Run into a problem? One could simply point people to most common problems list, or a faqs, or a helpful video and thus reduce the amount of time spent on such stressors.So what happened? Too much comfort and reliance in the spoon feeding. The non-stop flow from the infinite social media feed algorithms got into my daily routines. Why should I be looking for information? I’ll let that be fed to me based on the way I interact with things. I stopped being actively involved in this search. I relied too much on the feed algorithms. I got lazy and falsely expected good quality news to flow to me.… and it worked. But boy did this approach ever backfire on me.What I did not consider is the historical perspective. During my regular day-to-day usage, the social feed works well once you jump into that water. However, if you are like me and like to reference things at random times, then this approach starts to break. The infinite feed is not really productive especially if there is no predictable order to it. Moreover, you could run into an issue of not finding things in the future. This is especially prevelent if you are an early adopter.All of the unicorns, if the business is still around, experienced their fair share of messing with user’s data unintentionally. Be it permission to the data access, persistence of the data or lack of it, recovery of the data, pricing structures, and so on.How can a random user be confident in a random service? Will the data be available to the user in the future? Will you be able to access the data? How much access will you have? For how long? How do you export the data? Can you? Should you? How do you share the knowledge with a friend? Someone who is outside of your wall? Will there be a good relationship between the business and the user? Does the relationship change if you pay?I am questioning if it is fair of us as consumers to be asking things that we want to be asking of technology giants. I am also questioning if we have any good examples of great businesses left in software? Examples that a random person on the street may be familiar with and not the outliers.Ok… now that you have some background I will move on to the why I even started typing this piece.Imagine me a few days ago when I stumbled upon a random website. I started reading the content and saw that it was written by Patrick Collison — the one from Stripe.com. He brought up a few interesting points that I did not consider regarding our (user’s) interaction with software. He said:  Will end-user applications ever be truly programmable? If so, how?  Emacs, Smalltalk, Genera, and VBA embody a vision of malleable end-user computing: if the application doesn’t do what you want, it’s easy to tweak or augment it to suit your purposes. Today, however, end-user software increasingly operates behind bulletproof glass. This is especially true in the growth areas: mobile and web apps. Furthermore, not only is it getting harder to manipulate the application logic itself, but it’s also becoming harder to directly manipulate your data. With Visual Basic, you can readily write a quick script to calculate some calendar analytics with Outlook. To do the same with Google Calendar is a very laborious chore.  End-user computing is becoming less a bicycle and more a monorail for the mind.  As a consequence, we need ever more domain-specific software. Rather than use universal tools for handling charts and for manipulating data, we tend to use separate analytics packages for every conceivable application. This is not all bad. Domain-specific tools can maximize ease-of-use and help amortize the cost of complex, specialized functionality. Sublime’s built-in ⌘-T works better than every third-party Emacs package. Still, despite these benefits, the popularity of macros and browser plugins strongly suggest that users are smart and want more control.  Should we just give up on our earlier visions of empowered users or is a better equilibrium possible?The quote above (with my own highlights) was retrieved on October 3, 2018.Very interesting perspective Patrick. A view that I am glad you shared and definitely will make me think in the future. More specifically, I did not see what kind of doors something like VBA opened for everyone. With VBA, a user has the ability to play while avoiding 3rd party reliance. This was probably huge when it came about to the customers.I’m afraid to admit that I used to think: why on earth would you use VBA in 2016? 2017? 2018? Well, if you are stuck and have nothing else at your disposal, it surely looks like a really good tool to use.You have to remember and put yourself in that context. A context of a typical worker that is constrained by an administrator. In such a situation, usually, everything is turned off by default (because risk mitigation strategy). This way, if you need something to be turned on or installed then then need to submit a service request. You basically need to cry for help. Moreover, things like cost, licensing, needs, and wants come into play during such a request. These things require justification. Because, business after-all.If you are in such a unique position and you are constrained, then you may need to get creative. How do you solve such a problem? Create your own shortcuts. See a repetitive tasks? Automate it. Boring task? Automate it.So, how can you do this automation? Lots of creative approaches, say  buy an automaton thing or get creative with something like Zapier or IFTTT products  ask coworker to see what they would do  ask your boss and see what they say  research and see what tools are available to you (at your level) or your boss  open up a browser and the developer’s console -&gt; JavaScript to the rescueOR you could simply  learn &amp; use VBA (that is already installed on your environment)Problem solved!If you take a step back, suppose you go back four years ago to 2014, then I am not sure if I would have even written this article. You have to remember that technology moves fast. But I can definitely assure you that open up a browser and the developer's console -&gt; JavaScript to the rescue definitely would not have been up there as a solution.JavaScript wasn’t where it is now. If your only option was Internet Explorer then you definitely did not enjoy JavaScript. There was a lot of lapses (language features and browser support). I definitely never imagined seeing something like async in my browser’s console. Heck, your development tools that are packed in your web browser weren’t where they are now in October of 2018. I am not even talking about other significant improvements done over the years.So, my take away was an interesting one. I can understand and appreciate the importance of being creative within software constraints a little bit more. I can open up my Excel 2013 and create a macro to do pretty much what I want it to do. It just works and I can be a little bit more productive. If I wanted to do something similar with Google Sheets hypothetically, I would probably have to sign up for a new service and transfer some of my data along the way. Thus, perpetuating the moving of your data throughout the Internet while leaving little crumbs along the way. Is it bad? Is it good? Are these the right questions? Depends on model and the simulation I suppose ;-)But I am also glad to see impactful people asking important questions.See you tomorrow.",
            "content_html": "<p>Over the past year, I’ve noticed a trend that I’m starting to accummulate a running list of blogs, articles, and people that I find interesting. A list that I curate and maintain manually — a practice that everyone prior to SAAS explosion used to be intimately familiar with: using bookmarks.</p><p>Why am I going back to doing this? I jumped in just like everyone else on the social media train that started moving in the early 2000s.</p><p>As this train moved further away from the station, I noticed that I changed the way I interacted with information. Instead of saving things locally on my computer, I would off-load it to the cloud. At first, it made it very convenient for myself: I wouldn’t need to worry about hard-drive crashes or lost information. Even then — a failing hard-drive almost never crossed my mind during my day-to-day uses even if I was mindful of its risk. I finally knew where I could find anything. No more plugging in different hard drives and searching for my things. (and storage capacities at prices that I could not afford previously).</p><p>Eventually, the technology improved and added things I did not know I was missing. Specifically — the sharing and collaborating features. The cloud ecosystems enabled the possibility of sharing interesting information with others. Most importantly, it allowed for asynchronous (and real-time) working experience with others and paved the remote work movement. In other words, saving things locally was a thing of the past. Archaic. Everything. Always. Stayed somewhere else.</p><p>Problems? What problems? All of our problems went away we were told by marketers. Previously, if I shared information with someone there were many variables involved in the process: from compressing, to transfer, to uptime, and so on. Now, there were no more problems. If you cannot get my shared documents then something is wrong on your end; with the way you are doing things. Run into a problem? One could simply point people to most common problems list, or a faqs, or a helpful video and thus reduce the amount of time spent on such stressors.</p><p>So what happened?
