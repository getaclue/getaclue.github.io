Ruby on Rails was trending among the software craftsperson community throughout the 2010s and in the late 2000s. And I say ruby on rails not ruby. Personally, I do not happen to care very much for Ruby. It looks the same as Python and even is written using similar syntax and notation. However, it just so happens that ruby on rails was built using Ruby. It provided quick way to create projects while being the talk of everyone. The most productive framework if you may. Part of the fun was that everyone was creating using it. As a result, you could find people using ruby on rails in many places and you feel a sense of community without being in one.Among the fun experience, ruby on rails also provided various tools and features that came out of the box. This would cut down the development time extremely short and increase developer productivity. However, as the time went on and the framework stabilized, the craze died down and trend moved elsewhere. People and companies stopped using ruby on rails and moved on to JavaScript or other languages and frameworks. That is the purpose of trends, to move to the next one… not all of them moved because of trends … I know.It makes sense that ruby on rails was the king for a while. JavaScript (among other frameworks and languages) was not where it is in 2020 and Nodejs was not even a thing. Let alone having LTS releases of Nodejs that enterprise could use and rely on.Now, I am talking from MY experience and my day-to-day programming. Or should I say ranting about my experience with ruby on rails.The biggest negative I found, while working on rails, is that the systems usually turn into spaghetti code. I’ve seen this happen time after time first hand. This type of environment is definitely not fun to untangle or add features to. It becomes work minus the fun. Second, rails is fairly resource intensive and for a good reason – it comes with a lot of utility out of the box. Third, making rails fast is possible but requires some rolling up of the sleeves and jumping into the framework specific adjustments. Fourth, and this one is kind of my pet peeve … having ruby on rails work differently from its intension, from convention over configuration, is a headache. Moreover, you should be familiar with enough of the framework as to not damage other parts that you may be modifying.Don’t get me wrong, ruby on rails is still my goto for starting new projects but it is not as fun as it used to be. I want to be working on problems not debating if I should ditch ruby on rails for something else. I do wonder if it is laziness at this point or familiarity that is preventing me from jumping ruby ship. There is far less people using it and far less excitement talking to other programmers using the framework. It is harder to find like minded people. It seems that DHH from Basecamp is the only one that is still spearheading how awesome and relevant ruby on rails is. It is his investment after all.Sure you can have any of these problems in any other language or framework. And sure, my problems listed above can be fixed by refactoring, reading the documents, staying with the convention, and just doing the work. When you start fixing the problems, it becomes additional work that someone has to do that is hard to sell to a manager. All of this to say, is that it removes the fun for me.I’ve been thinking this for some time now and wanted to put it in words and archive it.

What I mean by that is — I wanted to send and receive email using something like: info@cspray.caIt is super exciting for me because it definitely gives cspray.ca a new level of professionalism. Plus it looks super cool and official. Now that I’ve done it, I want to document the tl;dr of the process for myself and share with you along the way. I wish I would have done this sooner because it is really EASY to do.  I’ve had email catchers before but I’ve never had the opportunity to send emails from my own domain. Plus, I’ve been looking at trying out new tools for my email anyway. I’ve been with google’s email service since its inception. All of the things aligned.So here is the tl;dr of the requirements if you want to follow along.  NOTE: I am using affiliate links for digitalocean and linode. If you were going to open up a new VPS anyway… why not send a few referral bucks myway? Every penny helps my dear friend &lt;3I am using:  namecheap for my domain ( but I do all of the DNS stuff via digitalocean )  digitalocean * for my VPS that also hosts my cspray.ca domain  digitalocean * control panel for domains setup  fastmail for the email service      NOTE: I am planning to move away from digitalocean. Testing linode at the moment. Looks promising. Open to suggestions =)  At the present, I manage my domain from my VPS panel located on digitalocean. All of my information is contained in one place.And the best part? You have a 30 day trial to see if it works for youNOTE: I found this blog post to be super useful!tl;dr — the final version will be :Add 3 CNAME Records            Type      Hostname      Value      TTL (seconds)                  CNAME      fm3._domainkey.cspray.ca      is an alias of fm3.cspray.ca.dkim.fmhosted.com      3600              CNAME      fm2._domainkey.cspray.ca      is an alias of fm2.cspray.ca.dkim.fmhosted.com      3600              CNAME      fm1._domainkey.cspray.ca      is an alias of fm1.cspray.ca.dkim.fmhosted.com      3600      Add 2 MX Records            Type      Hostname      Value      Priority      TTL (seconds)                  MX      cspray.ca      mail handled by in2-smtp.messagingengine.com.      20      3600              MX      cspray.ca      mail handled by in2-smtp.messagingengine.com.      10      3600      Add 1 TXT Record            Type      Hostname      Value      TTL (seconds)                  TXT      cspray.ca      returns v=spf1 include:spf.messagingengine.com ?all      3600      After 3 CNAME, 2 MX, and 1 TXT entries …go check on your fastmail account setting dashboard under domains. Everything should just work. If not, there is a button to try again or refresh or something along those lines to start the process again in case there was an error.Note: Mac native Mail.app installation  follow the automatic installation link that you get during the process of creating a brand new application password  it works as of 2018-12-10 19:13:12 on Mojave 10.14.2Note: iOS 12 installationI tried to follow fastmail’s tutorial for adding an account so that I can receive and send my email using the native Apple’s Mail.app. More specifically, I got stuck on the following screen:The work around is simple: just enter it manually. Check out this example.  Incoming Host Name: imap.fastmail.com  Username: your full FastMail username, including the domain.      Password: your iPhone app password (What’s an app password?)    Outgoing Host Name: smtp.fastmail.com  Username: your full FastMail username, including the domain.

            "content_text": "From Object Oriented JavaScript (Part the First)var literalDog = {        // declaration AND instantiation    name: \"Vincent\",      // object property    speak: function() {   // object method        return this.name + \" says woof\";    }};literalDog.speak();  // \"Vincent says woof\"  Inside of the speak method the this variable will refer to the current context of the function execution. This is an important distinction with classically object oriented languages: the value of this can (and often does) change! In most cases, this inside of a method like the one above will refer to the current object or instance. Without some other influence, if a method is called with “dot” syntax as in the last line above, then you can generally expect this inside the function to be whatever is on the left side of the dot. Inside of literalDog.speak() the this variable will refer to the object left of the dot: literalDog.function Dog(name) {    if (name) { this.name = name; }    this.speak = function() {        return this.name + \" says woof\";    }}var v = new Dog(\"Vincent\");  First of all, the use of the capitol “D” in Dog is only done by convention, this is not a requirement of the language.which obviously leads to  … any function in JavaScript can be used as a “constructor” …So, naturally  If Dog is just a regular function, why don’t we just call it normally? Why do we need to use the new keyword?Yeah man, why?  To answer that, we have to understand that every function in JavaScript has a concept of a prototype; which is, generally speaking, a representation of what the newly created instance should be.So, a function is an object. An object that uses this prototype concept to define itself. As a result, when we are calling the new reserved keyword, what happens is three of the following things.  Create an empty object;  set the new object’s prototype to point to the prototype;  and call the constructor method on the new object.  The reason for illustrating what the new keyword is doing is to highlight that it is not the same as classically inherited languages. In JavaScript, new is syntactic sugar and nothing else.I am not sure why but I really liked this explanation. JavaScript has a lot of interesting concepts that you don’t really need to master in order for everything to work.I went ahead with his examplefunction Dog(name){if (name) { this.name = name; }this.speak = function() {return this.name + \" says woof\";}}and then I used it the regular way that I am used tovar doggo = new Dog(\"Thunder\");doggo.speak();&gt; \"Thunder says woof\"but I also implemented it the new way. I am not used to creating objects this way, but it adds to my javascript knowledge for surevar otherDoggo = Object.create(Dog.prototype); // step 1 and step 2otherDoggo.constructor(\"Thunder\"); // step 3otherDoggo.speak();&gt; \"Thunder says woof\"To be honest with you, I would prefer to use it this way just because it allows me to context switch between other concepts and javascript way faster. Seeing the new keyword almost automatically makes me think in a wrong way.To which the author of the article made a note  There are some people in the JavaScript community who feel that syntactic sugar like the new keyword does more harm than good and choose not to use it at all. However, with ECMAScript 6 (ES6) pushing for more syntactic sugar surrounding OOP, it is unlikely that it will lose favor on a wider scale.and that is so. People prefer to write shorter syntax but I believe it makes learning such a weird language a bit more challenging. Which is fine.A side issue — which is prevelant everywhere in software — nobody goes back and fixes all of the old tutorials. As a result JavaScript evolves but the answers you get when you search on google or stackoverflow can be from any date.What if you are following some JavaScript tutorial and trying to understand some concepts. None of the tutorials ever state that JavaScript implementation is browser specific and environment specific. Yes … the various vendors are finally becoming similar but there are small differences. Afterall, the vendors are simply implementing ECMAScript.You still see these differences in 2018. For example, if I go back to the same article as I linked above, the text expects you to see something like&gt; console.log(Dog.prototype);{    constructor: Dog(name) {        if (name) { this.name = name; }    },    name: \"Bubbles\",    speak: function() {        return this.name + \" says woof\";    },    __proto__: Object { ... }}but what you see in most up-to-date firefox iswhereas in chrome you seeso my strategy my dear friend would be to understand the fundamentals. This way, you can adjust the syntax based on your environment. Unfortunately this will be so until all vendors catch up (if ever). Looking back on the past few years — I trully believed we would have it standardized by now.Another thing, if you read the previous essay, that I wanted to improve my understanding in was the indirect invocation belowfunction Runner(name) {  console.log(this instanceof Rabbit); // =&gt; true  this.name = name;}function Rabbit(name, countLegs) {  console.log(this instanceof Rabbit); // =&gt; true  // Indirect invocation. Call parent constructor.  Runner.call(this, name);  this.countLegs = countLegs;}var myRabbit = new Rabbit('White Rabbit', 4);myRabbit; // { name: 'White Rabbit', countLegs: 4 }specificallyRunner.call(this, name);Today I seem to have discovered that answer from the same article  The parent method will not be automatically called for you!  The trick is that we can’t simply call Animal() directly because the context inside that function will not be correct. Calling a function like that would typically set this inside the function to point to the window object, our default context.and if you recall JavaScript has several ways to invoke functions. It is important to understand because this is set during invocation. Thus, that is exactly how this type of function invocation in JavaScript works.  … Instead, we have to manually call the Animal constructor function while changing its context to point to our new Dog instance.function Animal(age) {    if (age) { this.age = age; }    var alive = true;    this.isAlive = function() { return alive; }    this.die = function() { alive = false; }}Animal.prototype.age = 1;function Dog(name) {    if (name) { this.name = name; }}function Animal(age) { /* ... */ }Animal.prototype.age = 1;function Dog(name) { /* ... */ }Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;Dog.prototype.name = \"Bubbles\";// The remainder of Dog.prototype members...var v = new Dog(\"Vincent\");  The key to understanding this relationship is understanding that the prototype object is a fall back mechanism.  [i]f the current instance object (v) does not have an age property directly on it JavaScript will “fall back” to the first prototype (Dog.prototype) and look for age there. If that object doesn’t have an age property, JavaScript will “fall back” to the next prototype, in this case Animal.prototype (defined by the __proto__ member of Dog.prototype). There it is! JavaScript found a member called age on the Animal.prototype and will use that value.  This structure is referred to as the prototype chain and falling back to successive prototypes is the mechanism by which JavaScript creates inheritance.Polymorphism  But this is not exactly polymorphism since the two functions do not share a name or form (different method signatures). To show how JavaScript supports this concept we need another example.  Notice how the Animal object has an age property. This is great, but perhaps we want the age to always be represented in “human years” (which we’ll assume is the default).SoAnimal.prototype.getAge = function() { return this.age; }and consequentlyDog.prototype.getAge = function() {    var dogYears = Animal.prototype.getAge.apply(this);    return (dogYears * 7);}Thus both Dog and Animal have getAge() but the functionality is a bit different. I’ll let the author explain as they do a good job  There are a couple things to note in the example above. First, we must use the method as it is defined on the Animal.prototype in order to call the parent method. If we try to simply call this.getAge() JavaScript will think we want the Dog.prototype.getAge method and we’ll enter a recursive, infinite loop! Second, we have to use the apply method of the getAge function object in order to switch the context again. Remember, if we were to simply call the method as is (Animal.prototype.getAge()) then the context will be the object on the left side of the dot: Animal.prototype. It will not be our Dog instance!  Once we have retrieved the stored age value, we can simply return that value multiplied by 7. In this manner we are able to achieve polymorphism by having a method with the same name and same function signature, but with different implementations depending on the type of object (Animal versus Dog versus Cat).While we are able to write code that looks something likeclass Dog extends Animal {  constructor(name, age) {    super(age);  // Call parent method of the same name    if (name) { this._name = name; }  }  get name() {    return this._name + \" (the dog)\";  }  set name(value) {    this._name = value.toLowerCase();  }  speak() {    return this.name + \" says woof\";  }}It is nice to know the prototypical background of the language. It is the foundation of the language and how it fundamentally  works. This way it does not matter which abstractions are built on top — you simply adjust =)I had a lot of issues learning JavaScript as I was coming from a typical accredited computer science background. JavaScript is this frankenstein of a language that dominates the present software terrain. However, the varied implementation by vendors is less than ideal for its stability to teach new staff and overall well being of the language. I wish there was a better management of outdated information. JavaScript is constantly changing so I am not sure if this is possible in this never ending race.Reminds me of the issues that people had surrounding learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails: the various syntactic magic that goes behind the scenes. I don’t think all of this magic is an issue in JavaScript environment for one big reason — JavaScript is free and all you need is a browser. Nobody to pay any fees; nothing to install; do not need to pay for an IDE. Plus, you get to take all of the invested development hours and use it for free.Can’t say the same for Ruby on Rails or any other language or framework.See you next time",

Like I mentioned before, I understand the subject matter but not as deep as I would like to.So, I began by looking backwards: I wanted to figure out during which course I was introduced to them first. I knew that it was around first or second year; and I knew that it was in Calculus. I did not remember if it was Calculus I or Calculus II. I could not remember but why struggle when you can look this up? Since my degree is from an accredited institution that provides accredited degrees — I can simply request this information or look it up. All of the courses and their description is fully published at uOttawa so this took me a few minutes.Turns out it was first introduced to me during Calculus II. While I didn’t have my notes, I did recall which textbook I used to study and I recall exactly where we studied this. I did have the textbook so I just went ahead and looked it up. And then everything clicked in for me — I figured out how I got confused around series and sequences.It was precisely in Chapter 8 of this (not) so wonderful textbook by James Stewart. Why do I say not so wonderful? Because, looking on the order of topics presented in retrospect, sequences, series, and limits of these things were introduced at the same time. What I did not realize when I was younger — professors usually follow a textbook for their instructions. So, if the textbook does not match your studying techniques then the way the knowledge is delivered via professor will not aid.Sequence is introduced as:  A sequence can be thought of as a list of numbers written in a definite order …Ok good I can follow that. One thing that should have been bolded, in my opinion, was the definite order part of the definition but it was not. Right after the definition, we were shown three ways of describing a sequence:  … one by using the preceding notation, another by using the defining formula, and a third by writing out the terms of the sequence …Ok, even though I’ve never seen this before presented like this I can follow along. Then they moved to describing how you could find such a description on your own via an example:  … [n]otice that the numerators of these fractions start with 3 and increase by 1 whenever we go to the next term. The second term has numerator 4, the third term has numerator 5; in general, the nth term will have numerator n + 2. The denominators are the powers of 5,  … so an has denominator 5n. The signs of the terms are alternately positive and negative, so we need to multiply by a power of 1. In Example 1(b) the factor …  meant we started with a negative term. Here we want to start with a positive term and so we use …Looking at it now — there is a lot going on above and definitely went above my head when I was introduced OR I did not understand it. But that was not the culprit — you can get by just fine with not understanding this.On the same page we get some new examples of sequences that is introduced as  … sequences that don’t have simple defining equationsBoom. Problem 1 — sequences don’t have simple defining equations. That is such a subtle and non-bolded way of describing an important property of sequences. But don’t worry, as you keep reading this example, one sub-example at a time, you come to the famous Fibonacci sequence that everyone loves to introduce.And how do they introduce this example? Using limits ofcourse. This is calculus afterall. This was Problem 2 for my understanding. These two problems are the reasons where everything went downhill. The text went on to the properties such as convergence and divergence and others. Nowhere, was there a connection of some sort to series.This is what I meanAnd how was a series introduced?  What do we mean when we express a number as an infinite decimal? For instance, what does it mean to write…  … The convention behind our decimal notation is that any number can be written as an infinite sum. Here it means that…  … where the three dots … indicate that the sum continues forever, and the more terms we add, the closer we get to the actual value of pi.Does it make sense to you if you were seeing this for the first time? It did not for me. If you keeping reading there is a mention of a connection between a sequence and a serience  … Thus the sum of a series is the limit of the sequence of partial sums. …so I cannot say that the author did not connect the ideas.

            "content_text": "Today I ended up exploring a topic that I didn’t expect: what is the difference between a sequence and a series.While I memorized these contepts in my calculus days, I always felt something was missing in my core understanding. I think I figured out what was missing. It seems that I was confused, once again, around the ambiguity of the English language.I stumbled upon the following in one of my favourite textbooks:  A numeric progression is a sequence of numbers, where each number depends on one or more of the previous numbers.followed by  arithmetic progression determines the next number by adding a fixed constant to the previous valueand  geometric progression determines the next number by multiplying the previous value by a fixed constantwhich made me go Aha. All I had to do was check if the thing was made by adding or by multiplying? Seems easy enough to get.I’m sure I had the same thoughts back in school. So, I decided to play around and see what I find confusing so I could fix my gaps in knowledge. I thought: hmm, they are using both terms, a progression and sequence, in one sentence. Confused — because if you don’t really pay attention then you could interpret these two terms as having a similar meaning.What I should have considered was the specific word choice in math. Similar confusions were found in other areas. For example, different terminology in the graph space. One positive thing that I did notice is that specialty books are beginning to mention discrepancies surrounding word choice.Getting back to progression and sequence confusion. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that I had confusion back in the day. Confusion around terminology and not the concepts. If you read one of the previous entries, then you recall me saying that pattern matching works to a certain degree. So, I used pattern matching during my former student days. It got me far enough but I was never satisfied.Unlike my former student self, I have the leisure and time to explore this further.I found the following excerpt on quora from how does sequence and progression differ?  … all progressions are sequences, all sequences are not progression …OK, so that brought my understanding a bit closer. So a sequence is a collection of things. Hmm, but that sounds very close to what a set is. So, what is the difference between a sequence and a set? Is there one? Decided to consult wonderful wikipedia definition for more information.So a sequence is like a set because they are a collection that contains things: members or elements. Like a set, this collection can be finite or infinite. Ok… so still not too clear so far. However, as we read further — what we find, is that in a sequence, unlike in a set, repeated occurences of members are allowed. Additionally, unlike in a set, the order of individual members in the collection matters.Furthermore, a sequence does not have to be only denoted by [an explicit] formula. A sequence can also be denoted by a logical statement:  A sequence may be denoted by an explicit formula, like Tn = 2 + n, or it may be denoted by a logical statement like Tn = nth prime number. It is not necessary that a set of numbers be arranged according to an explicit formula in order for it to be called a ‘sequence’; it can also be arranged according to some logical statement that does not have an explicit mathematical formula but is nonetheless mathematically logical in order for it to be called a sequence.So, the definition of a sequence and how it differs from a set is starting to make sense. How does a progression relate to all of this? Well, a numeric progression is a sequence of numbers where each element depends on one or more of the previous members.Just like in the quote above from the textbook, it follows that there are at least two such relationships:  a relationship between two members such that the difference between these two members is a constant — this is called an arithmetic progression or arithmetic sequence.  a relationship between two members such that the quotient of any two successive members of the sequence is a constant — this is called a geometric progression or a geometric sequence.Or said it another way (from the same textbook as mentioned):  geometric progression, in which each value is produced by multiplying the preceding value by a fixed constant, known as the base of the geometric progression.We have looked at a set, sequence, and a progression so far. How do these things relate to a series? Very simple — a series is just the summation of all of the elements in the sequence. So, it then follows, what is the sum of the elements in a given sequence represented by? A series. Just like that. It finally makes sense how a series and a sequence are related. Nothing complicated. No new formulas. Just the proper definitions presented in a familiar way.Moreover, the total sum of the sequence can be broken up into partial sum(s) — a sum from element ai to element an. What is interesting about this? Well the fact that (p)artial sums, themselves, form a sequence.Well, there you have it.See you tomorrow.",

Well, a <em>numeric</em> progression is a <strong>sequence</strong> of <em>numbers</em> where each element depends on <em>one or more</em> of the <strong>previous</strong> members.</p><p>Just like in the quote above from the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118771338/\">textbook</a>, it follows that there are at least two such relationships:</p><ol>  <li>a relationship between two members such that the difference between these two members is a constant — this is called an <em>arithmetic progression</em> or <em>arithmetic sequence</em>.</li>  <li>a relationship between two members such that the <a href=\"https://www.math10.com/en/algebra/geometric-progression.html\">quotient of any two successive members of the sequence is a constant</a> — this is called a <em>geometric progression</em> or a <em>geometric sequence</em>.</li></ol><p>Or said it another way (from the same <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118771338/\">textbook</a> as mentioned):</p><blockquote>  <p>geometric progression, in which each value is produced by multiplying the preceding value by a fixed constant, known as the <strong>base of the geometric progression</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>We have looked at a set, sequence, and a progression so far. How do these things relate to a <em>series</em>? Very simple — a series is just the summation of all of the elements in the sequence. So, it then follows, what is the sum of the elements in a given sequence represented by? A series. Just like that. It finally makes sense how a series and a sequence are related. Nothing complicated. No new formulas. Just the proper definitions presented in a familiar way.</p><p>Moreover, the total sum of the sequence can be broken up into <strong>partial sum(s)</strong> — a sum from element <code>ai</code> to element <code>an</code>. What is interesting about this? Well the fact that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence\">(p)artial sums, themselves, form a sequence</a>.</p><p>Well, there you have it.</p><p>See you tomorrow.</p>",

So, here is what my MVP looks like so far.For this problem I wanted to use a large piece of text as input. For example, I was reading the news earlier and I found a good candidate. I used the following news article as my input:  Ontario has promised to add 15,000 new long-term care beds across of the province in the next five years and increasing that to 30,000 in a decade.  Of the 6,000 being put in place immediately, 80 of them will be in Brant County.  “Your government is moving forward quickly to expand access to long-term care beds,” said Christine Elliott, the Deputy Premier and Minister of Health and Long-Term Care in a press release. “”More long-term care beds will help take the pressure off hospitals, end hallway medicine, allow doctors and nurses to work more efficiently and provide faster health care for Ontario patients and their families.”  The 80 beds will be shared between John Noble Home and Fox Ridge Care Community (Sienna Senior Living).  The province has also promised more than 1,100 beds and spaces in hospitals and community settings.  “This is good news for the people of Brantford-Brant,” said MPP Will Bouma in the release.which I grabbed from here so you know it is very fresh — Published Monday, October 8, 2018 5:31PM EDT.I then ran the MVP implementation against this input, and surprise surprise.

Most likely than not the things that I share I hope others to find useful and educational.</p><p>Links for today:</p><ul>  <li><a href=\"http://files.zeroturnaround.com/pdf/zt_regular-expressions-cheat-sheet.pdf\">http://files.zeroturnaround.com/pdf/zt_regular-expressions-cheat-sheet.pdf</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://regexr.com/\">https://regexr.com/</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10253516/ruby-regex-replace-non-word-chars-that-are-not-space-chars\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10253516/ruby-regex-replace-non-word-chars-that-are-not-space-chars</a></li>  <li><a href=\"http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-internationalization/simpledateformat.html\">http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-internationalization/simpledateformat.html</a></li>  <li><a href=\"http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaRegularExpressions/article.html\">http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaRegularExpressions/article.html</a></li>  <li><a href=\"http://www.java2s.com/Tutorials/Java/java.time/LocalDateTime/2720__LocalDateTime.now_.htm\">http://www.java2s.com/Tutorials/Java/java.time/LocalDateTime/2720_<em>LocalDateTime.now</em>.htm</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/manipstrings.html\">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/manipstrings.html</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid/filters/string-filters\">https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid/filters/string-filters</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://devhints.io/jekyll\">https://devhints.io/jekyll</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/mikeygee/2626538\">https://gist.github.com/mikeygee/2626538</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/JJediny/a466eed62cee30ad45e2\">https://gist.github.com/JJediny/a466eed62cee30ad45e2</a></li></ul>",

I have a specific way I name these files: It goes date-title.markdown so it is easier for me to reference in the future.

If you look at the link, you know that it is a fresh article without even reading it ;-) People like me like to read things like this. While it is fine to do it manually once in a while, it became too repetative to me. SPM to the rescue!IdeaMake a cli tool using SPM that can:  take input from cli  input like : $ tool \"Swift package manager october 2018\"  and provide output to me so I can copy/paste while I am creating a new file… oh and I get to write something today ;-)SolutionHere is my code:// main.swiftimport Foundationprivate let arguments: [String] = CommandLine.arguments//guard arguments.count &gt; 1, !arguments[1].isEmpty else {    print(\"Need some kind of arguments fam\")    exit(EXIT_FAILURE)}//let input = \"Will end-user applications ever be truly programmable?\"let input = arguments[1]let inputLowerCased = input.lowercased()//print(input)func dashifyText(_ inputTxt:String?) -&gt; String {    guard let input = inputTxt, !input.isEmpty else {        return \"\"    }    var result = \"\"    for character in input {        if (character == \" \") {            result = result + \"-\"        } else if(character == \"?\") {            result = result + \"\"        } else {            result = result + String(character)        }    }    return result}let currDateTime = Date()let dateFormatter = DateFormatter()// For example, short would have the basics: \"10/8/16, 10:52 PM\"dateFormatter.timeStyle = .shortdateFormatter.dateStyle = .shortlet currDateTimeText = dateFormatter.string(from: currDateTime)func dashifyDateTimeString(_ forString:String?) -&gt; String {    guard let dateTimeString = forString else {        return \"\"    }    var resultant = \"\"    for char in dateTimeString {        switch char {        case \"/\":            resultant = resultant + \"-\"        case \",\":            resultant = resultant + \"\"        case \":\":            resultant = resultant + \"-\"        case \" \":            resultant = resultant + \"-\"        default:            resultant = resultant + String(char)        }    }    return resultant}let dashifiedText = dashifyText(inputLowerCased)let dateTimeText = dashifyDateTimeString(currDateTimeText)let finalString = \"\\(dateTimeText)-\\(dashifiedText).markdown\"print(finalString)print(\"LENGTH: \\(finalString.count)\")and in the process, I’ve tried different things.

A list that I curate and maintain manually — a practice that everyone prior to SAAS explosion used to be intimately familiar with: using bookmarks.Why am I going back to doing this? I jumped in just like everyone else on the social media train that started moving in the early 2000s.As this train moved further away from the station, I noticed that I changed the way I interacted with information. Instead of saving things locally on my computer, I would off-load it to the cloud. At first, it made it very convenient for myself: I wouldn’t need to worry about hard-drive crashes or lost information. Even then — a failing hard-drive almost never crossed my mind during my day-to-day uses even if I was mindful of its risk. I finally knew where I could find anything. No more plugging in different hard drives and searching for my things. (and storage capacities at prices that I could not afford previously).Eventually, the technology improved and added things I did not know I was missing. Specifically — the sharing and collaborating features. The cloud ecosystems enabled the possibility of sharing interesting information with others. Most importantly, it allowed for asynchronous (and real-time) working experience with others and paved the remote work movement. In other words, saving things locally was a thing of the past. Archaic. Everything. Always. Stayed somewhere else.Problems? What problems? All of our problems went away we were told by marketers. Previously, if I shared information with someone there were many variables involved in the process: from compressing, to transfer, to uptime, and so on. Now, there were no more problems. If you cannot get my shared documents then something is wrong on your end; with the way you are doing things. Run into a problem? One could simply point people to most common problems list, or a faqs, or a helpful video and thus reduce the amount of time spent on such stressors.So what happened? Too much comfort and reliance in the spoon feeding. The non-stop flow from the infinite social media feed algorithms got into my daily routines. Why should I be looking for information? I’ll let that be fed to me based on the way I interact with things. I stopped being actively involved in this search. I relied too much on the feed algorithms. I got lazy and falsely expected good quality news to flow to me.… and it worked. But boy did this approach ever backfire on me.What I did not consider is the historical perspective. During my regular day-to-day usage, the social feed works well once you jump into that water. However, if you are like me and like to reference things at random times, then this approach starts to break. The infinite feed is not really productive especially if there is no predictable order to it. Moreover, you could run into an issue of not finding things in the future. This is especially prevelent if you are an early adopter.All of the unicorns, if the business is still around, experienced their fair share of messing with user’s data unintentionally. Be it permission to the data access, persistence of the data or lack of it, recovery of the data, pricing structures, and so on.How can a random user be confident in a random service? Will the data be available to the user in the future? Will you be able to access the data? How much access will you have? For how long? How do you export the data? Can you? Should you? How do you share the knowledge with a friend? Someone who is outside of your wall? Will there be a good relationship between the business and the user? Does the relationship change if you pay?I am questioning if it is fair of us as consumers to be asking things that we want to be asking of technology giants. I am also questioning if we have any good examples of great businesses left in software? Examples that a random person on the street may be familiar with and not the outliers.Ok… now that you have some background I will move on to the why I even started typing this piece.Imagine me a few days ago when I stumbled upon a random website. I started reading the content and saw that it was written by Patrick Collison — the one from Stripe.com. He brought up a few interesting points that I did not consider regarding our (user’s) interaction with software. He said:  Will end-user applications ever be truly programmable? If so, how?  Emacs, Smalltalk, Genera, and VBA embody a vision of malleable end-user computing: if the application doesn’t do what you want, it’s easy to tweak or augment it to suit your purposes. Today, however, end-user software increasingly operates behind bulletproof glass. This is especially true in the growth areas: mobile and web apps. Furthermore, not only is it getting harder to manipulate the application logic itself, but it’s also becoming harder to directly manipulate your data. With Visual Basic, you can readily write a quick script to calculate some calendar analytics with Outlook. To do the same with Google Calendar is a very laborious chore.  End-user computing is becoming less a bicycle and more a monorail for the mind.  As a consequence, we need ever more domain-specific software. Rather than use universal tools for handling charts and for manipulating data, we tend to use separate analytics packages for every conceivable application. This is not all bad. Domain-specific tools can maximize ease-of-use and help amortize the cost of complex, specialized functionality. Sublime’s built-in ⌘-T works better than every third-party Emacs package. Still, despite these benefits, the popularity of macros and browser plugins strongly suggest that users are smart and want more control.  Should we just give up on our earlier visions of empowered users or is a better equilibrium possible?The quote above (with my own highlights) was retrieved on October 3, 2018.Very interesting perspective Patrick. A view that I am glad you shared and definitely will make me think in the future. More specifically, I did not see what kind of doors something like VBA opened for everyone. With VBA, a user has the ability to play while avoiding 3rd party reliance. This was probably huge when it came about to the customers.I’m afraid to admit that I used to think: why on earth would you use VBA in 2016? 2017? 2018? Well, if you are stuck and have nothing else at your disposal, it surely looks like a really good tool to use.You have to remember and put yourself in that context. A context of a typical worker that is constrained by an administrator. In such a situation, usually, everything is turned off by default (because risk mitigation strategy). This way, if you need something to be turned on or installed then then need to submit a service request. You basically need to cry for help. Moreover, things like cost, licensing, needs, and wants come into play during such a request. These things require justification. Because, business after-all.If you are in such a unique position and you are constrained, then you may need to get creative. How do you solve such a problem? Create your own shortcuts. See a repetitive tasks? Automate it. Boring task? Automate it.So, how can you do this automation? Lots of creative approaches, say  buy an automaton thing or get creative with something like Zapier or IFTTT products  ask coworker to see what they would do  ask your boss and see what they say  research and see what tools are available to you (at your level) or your boss  open up a browser and the developer’s console -&gt; JavaScript to the rescueOR you could simply  learn &amp; use VBA (that is already installed on your environment)Problem solved!If you take a step back, suppose you go back four years ago to 2014, then I am not sure if I would have even written this article. You have to remember that technology moves fast. But I can definitely assure you that open up a browser and the developer's console -&gt; JavaScript to the rescue definitely would not have been up there as a solution.JavaScript wasn’t where it is now. If your only option was Internet Explorer then you definitely did not enjoy JavaScript. There was a lot of lapses (language features and browser support). I definitely never imagined seeing something like async in my browser’s console. Heck, your development tools that are packed in your web browser weren’t where they are now in October of 2018. I am not even talking about other significant improvements done over the years.So, my take away was an interesting one. I can understand and appreciate the importance of being creative within software constraints a little bit more. I can open up my Excel 2013 and create a macro to do pretty much what I want it to do. It just works and I can be a little bit more productive. If I wanted to do something similar with Google Sheets hypothetically, I would probably have to sign up for a new service and transfer some of my data along the way. Thus, perpetuating the moving of your data throughout the Internet while leaving little crumbs along the way. Is it bad? Is it good? Are these the right questions? Depends on model and the simulation I suppose ;-)But I am also glad to see impactful people asking important questions.See you tomorrow.",

One could simply point people to most common problems list, or a faqs, or a helpful video and thus reduce the amount of time spent on such stressors.</p><p>So what happened? Too much comfort and reliance in the spoon feeding. The non-stop flow from the infinite social media feed algorithms got into my daily routines. Why should I be looking for information? I’ll let that be fed to me based on the way I interact with things. I stopped being actively involved in this search. I relied too much on the feed algorithms. I got lazy and falsely expected good quality news to flow to me.</p><p>… and it worked. But boy did this approach ever backfire on me.</p><p>What I did not consider is the historical perspective. During my regular day-to-day usage, the social feed works well once you jump into that water. However, if you are like me and like to reference things at random times, then this approach starts to break. The infinite feed is not really productive especially if there is no predictable order to it. Moreover, you could run into an issue of not finding things in the future. This is especially prevelent if you are an early adopter.</p><p>All of the unicorns, if the business is still around, experienced their fair share of messing with user’s data unintentionally. Be it permission to the data access, persistence of the data or lack of it, recovery of the data, pricing structures, and so on.</p><p>How can a random user be confident in a random service? Will the data be available to the user in the future? Will you be able to access the data? How much access will you have? For how long? How do you export the data? Can you? Should you? How do you share the knowledge with a friend? Someone who is outside of your wall? Will there be a good relationship between the business and the user? Does the relationship change if you pay?</p><p>I am questioning if it is fair of us as consumers to be asking things that we want to be asking of technology giants. I am also questioning if we have any good examples of great businesses left in software? Examples that a random person on the street may be familiar with and not the outliers.</p><p>Ok… now that you have some background I will move on to the why I even started typing this piece.</p><p>Imagine me a few days ago when I stumbled upon a random website. I started reading the content and saw that it was written by <a href=\"https://patrickcollison.com/\">Patrick Collison</a> — the one from <a href=\"Stripe.com\">Stripe.com</a>. He brought up a <a href=\"https://patrickcollison.com/questions\">few interesting points</a> that I did not consider regarding our (user’s) interaction with software. He said:</p><blockquote>  <p>Will end-user applications ever be truly programmable? If so, how?</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>Emacs, Smalltalk, Genera, and VBA embody a vision of malleable end-user computing: if the application doesn’t do what you want, it’s easy to tweak or augment it to suit your purposes. <strong>Today, however, end-user software increasingly operates behind bulletproof glass</strong>. This is especially true in the growth areas: mobile and web apps. Furthermore, not only is it getting <strong>harder to manipulate</strong> the application logic itself, but it’s also becoming <strong>harder to directly manipulate</strong> your data. With Visual Basic, you can readily write a quick script to calculate some calendar analytics with Outlook. <strong>To do the same with Google Calendar is a very laborious chore</strong>.</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>End-user computing is becoming less a bicycle and <strong>more a monorail</strong> for the mind.</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>As a consequence, <strong>we need ever more domain-specific software</strong>. Rather than use universal tools for handling charts and for manipulating data, we tend to use separate analytics packages for every conceivable application. This is not all bad. Domain-specific tools can maximize ease-of-use and help amortize the cost of complex, specialized functionality. Sublime’s built-in ⌘-T works better than every third-party Emacs package. Still, despite these benefits, the popularity of macros and browser plugins strongly suggest that <strong>users are smart and want more control</strong>.</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>Should we just give up on our earlier visions of empowered users or is a better equilibrium possible?</p></blockquote><p>The quote above (with my own highlights) was retrieved on October 3, 2018.</p><p>Very interesting perspective Patrick. A view that I am glad you shared and definitely will make me think in the future. More specifically, I did not see what kind of doors something like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications\">VBA</a> opened for everyone. With VBA, a user has the ability to play while avoiding 3rd party reliance. This was probably huge when it came about to the customers.</p><p>I’m afraid to admit that I used to think: why on earth would you use VBA in 2016? 2017? 2018? Well, if you are stuck and have nothing else at your disposal, it surely looks like a really good tool to use.</p><p>You have to remember and put yourself in that context. A context of a typical worker that is constrained by an administrator. In such a situation, usually, everything is turned off by default (because risk mitigation strategy). This way, if you need something to be turned on or installed then then need to submit a service request. You basically need to cry for help. Moreover, things like cost, licensing, needs, and wants come into play during such a request. These things require justification. Because, business after-all.</p><p>If you are in such a unique position and you are constrained, then you may need to get creative. How do you solve such a problem? Create your own shortcuts. See a repetitive tasks? Automate it. Boring task? Automate it.</p><p>So, how can you do this automation? Lots of creative approaches, say</p><ul>  <li>buy an automaton thing or get creative with something like <a href=\"https://zapier.com/\">Zapier</a> or <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/\">IFTTT</a> products</li>  <li>ask coworker to see what they would do</li>  <li>ask your boss and see what they say</li>  <li>research and see what tools are available to you (at your level) or your boss</li>  <li>open up a browser and the developer’s console -&gt; JavaScript to the rescue</li></ul><p>OR you could simply</p><ul>  <li>learn &amp; use VBA (that is already installed on your environment)</li></ul><p>Problem solved!</p><p>If you take a step back, suppose you go back four years ago to 2014, then I am not sure if I would have even written this article. You have to remember that technology moves fast. But I can definitely assure you that <code>open up a browser and the developer's console -&gt; JavaScript to the rescue</code> definitely would not have been up there as a solution.</p><p>JavaScript wasn’t where it is now. If your only option was Internet Explorer then you definitely did not enjoy JavaScript. There was a lot of lapses (language features and browser support). I definitely never imagined seeing something like <code>async</code> in my browser’s console. Heck, your development tools that are packed in your web browser weren’t where they are now in October of 2018. I am not even talking about other significant improvements done over the years.</p><p>So, my take away was an interesting one. I can understand and appreciate the importance of being creative within software constraints a little bit more. I can open up my Excel 2013 and create a macro to do pretty much what I want it to do. It just works and I can be a little bit more productive. If I wanted to do something similar with Google Sheets hypothetically, I would probably have to sign up for a new service and transfer some of my data along the way. Thus, perpetuating the moving of your data throughout the Internet while leaving little crumbs along the way. Is it bad? Is it good? Are these the right questions? Depends on model and the simulation I suppose ;-)</p><p>But I am also glad to see impactful people asking important questions.</p><p>See you tomorrow.</p>",

            "content_text": "I just ran into “Discrete Mathematics For Computer Science” by Susanna S. Epp (13th International Congress on Mathematical Education Hamburg, 24-31 July 2016). The piece resonated with me and I decided to note some reflections from my own experience down.I added my own emphasis to the quotes below.  “The material in discrete structures is pervasive in the areas of data structures and algorithms but appears elsewhere in computer science as well.This statement resonates very well with me. During my education, there was a big emphasis on data structures and importance of maths in that field. However, there was almost no time spent on the appears elsewhere part of my studies. This left me frustrated lots of times primarily because I went into software engineering to learn about the application of theory.It is also how I know about Susanna S. Epp and her book Discrete Mathematics with Applications by Susanna S. Epp. When I found my education exposure was lacking, I started to search for different strategies to learn difficult material. It turns out, if you add a little bit of effort, then you can find an author in your field of interest that can help you learn this challenging material. An author that writes in a way that you can understand.Unfortunately, it is one thing that nobody talks about when you are having a difficult time understanding. The fact that if you are having a hard time studying, then a different solution or approach is needed for you  if you know that other approaches exist  if you look hard for it  if you take an initiative to self-study  and self-research.  […] an ability to create and understand a proof — either a formal symbolic proof or a less formal but still mathematically rigorous argument—is important in virtually every area of computer science, including (to name just a few) formal specification, verification, databases, and cryptography.  [g]raph theory concepts are used in networks, operating systems, and compilers.  Set theory concepts are used in software engineering and in databases.  Probability theory is used in intelligent systems, networking, and a number of computing applications.And while I do understand the reference points and examples — I only do so because I went through the system. Looking backwards, when I was learning at the beginning, I recall a big emphasis on data structures and graphs. However, there was no justification besides rote memorization and needing it for this degree.  This paper explores three reasons for the problem. One is that there has been a reduced emphasis on mathematical proof in the secondary mathematics curriculum.Anecdotally that was true in my experience. This subject matter was never fully conveyed to me - how proofs form the building blocks.  A study of teacher attitudes by Knuth (2002) indicated that the teachers “viewed proof as appropriate for the mathematics education of a minority of students” and that they saw proof “as a topic of study rather than as a tool for communicating and studying mathematics.”Yeap… ding ding ding. That’s how it was conveyed to me in Canadian school system as well.  A second is that the ways certain words and phrases are interpreted in ordinary speech often differ from the ways they must be interpreted in formal, deductive reasoning.I cannot tell you how much I struggled with this. The cognitive collusion between ordinary speech and formal reasoning. It is tough to get your head around the complicated subject matter. It really is.And these things follow you if you do not grasp them when first learning. As someone who had no English vocabulary, I was studying the new language in parallel as I was getting my education foundation and going through the education system. Not only does it make studying these concepts confusing, it also makes the entire field of Maths as some type of mountain that you cannot climb.I spent a lot of my time memorizing content without understanding. While this approach works to some degree, it almost always fails as you get higher up the knowledge ladder.What I did not realize, at the time that I was struggling, was that the road blocks should have signaled to me that I had foundational issues. Instead, I plowed forward without having the full picture.I understand this now and it is part of the reason why I read up on things like this in my free time.  One of their tasks as students is to learn how to extract the standard interpretation from what is said and written. One of the tasks of instructors is to teach them how to do that.100% did not experience this. In all of my experience so far the instructors believed in rote replication via writing. While this may work for some learning styles, it really did not work for me.  One example is that in everyday speech if-then is frequently interpreted as if-and-only-if.Did I find this confusing? Check.  Only-if is also routinely interpreted as if-and-only-if.Did I find this confusing? Check.  In propositional logic the negation of “if A then B” is the conjunction “A and not B,” …Did I find this confusing? Check.It is a bit hard to reflect on this now because I am much more familiar with this subject. But I will try to step back and play around with my thoughts. The author mentions that students seem to reply if A then not B as the common solution to the negation.While I can justify that response in my head, my brain wants to say if not A then not B but it definitely doesn’t think not A or B nor not A and B. Sure, I know the theory and I know about truth tables. And, if I force myself then I can definitely come up to the solution.However, what I am saying is that it is still challenging to think about these things when you have mental clashes with your everyday speech.See:  For instance, a natural response to “If John comes, then the party will be a disaster” is “Don’t worry. If John comes, then the party will not be a disaster. It will be fine.”This takes the language issue a bit further:  According to the rules of predicate logic, when a statement contains two different quantifiers, they should be interpreted in left-right order. However in ordinary language a statement with both for-all and there-is is typically interpreted in whatever way makes the most common sense. Linguists call this “scope ambiguity.”See:  For example, the most natural way to interpret the sentence, “There is a lid for every pot” is as “For every pot there is a lid” not as “There is one single lid that will be fit every pot.”Think about this.  A third is the difficulties students experience in understanding and using statements involving variables, both in connection with predicate logic and in interpreting certain kinds of mathematical phrases.Very true but to me, this stems from issue created in #2 regarding language.I liked the following examples provided in the piece:  What we say — What we mean          the value of x — the quantity that is put in place ofx      as the value of x increases — as larger and larger numbers are put in place of x      As the value of x increases, the value of y increases. — If larger and larger numbers are put in place of x, the corresponding numbers that are put in place of y become larger and larger.      where x is any real number — for all possible substitutions of real numbers in place of x      Let n be any even number — Imagine substituting an integer in place of n but do not assume anything about its value except that it is an even integer.      By definition of even, n = 2k for some integer k — By definition of even, there is an integer we can substitude in place of k so that the equation n = 2k will be true. (In fact, there is only one such integer; its value is n/2)      the function x^2 — the function that relates each real number to the square of that number. In other words, for each possible substitution of a real number in place of x, the function corresponds to the square of that number.      where x is some real number that satisfies the given property — There is a real number that will make the given property true if we substitude it in place of x.      While I respect the author and the work she does, it appears that math education is a loosing battle. I skimmed through author’s article from 1987 (The Logic of Teaching Calculus. In Toward a Lean and Lively Calculus: Report of the Conference Workshop to Develop Curriculum and Teaching Methods for Calculus at the College Level. Ronald G. Douglas, Ed. Washington, D.C.: Mathematical Association of America, 1987, 41-59.) where she outlined similar concerns around logic (only that time it was in the context of calculus).It has been more than 30 years and it appears that new students are continuing to struggle with maths. Anecdotally, I hear concerned systems and parents pushing for programming skills while pushing away core maths. If you found math challenging or confusing I encourage you not to give up. You can study it on your own.Start your studies wherever you got confused. There are tests available that can help you narrow it down. Start from grade 1 if you want to. Who is going to judge? Open up khan academy and go to town. Discover the beauty and study on your own time… I did (and I still am).If it wasn’t for Khan Academy, self-studying, youtube, and the people of the internet in general — I am not sure if I would be where I am.",

So how have I been doing?On the whole, I have been doing way better than any of my previous years. If you take a look at this year alone, I have published 11 pieces of work so far.

I feel like I could be doing better in this area. I still find myself falling into the trap of not publishing. Reflecting on this progress definitely helps to stay on track.So, I think I am doing OK even if it doesn’t feel like that. I give myself the permission to make mistakes, publish more frequent and unfinished work; and continue this journey that I started.What happened since the last post?  in June/July/August, I finished the backend &amp; frontend MVP for dailyvibes          the said backend and frontend are not live yet to anyone but you may see some things here      PS, as an aside — I am considering migrating away from github to self-hosted for all of my work        in July, worked on screenhole and created an MVP for a Mac OS screen recorder functionality. That was a fun experiment that you can view at https://screenhole.net/getaclue/~g8U2vv Unfortunately that is not a public feature and is stuck in alpha/beta stage until further notice.  in July/August, worked on keyframes native Mac app. Was a bit of work but looks nice in my opinion. This work is in beta and is available for download.  in August, launched our physical product at the Canadian National Exhibition. That was intense. Will talk about this more at a later time ;-) but lets just say we are continuing working on this project. This was a FIRST for us and also a BIG deal!!!          Attendance: 1.54 million (2016) — may hint to you at why. And we made sure to talk to almost everyone that passed by us. I say almost because it was just the two of us.        in September, started to work on news article parser for elderoost. One of the current challenges is keeping up to news. I physically read all of the articles manually and filter them manually. This honestly takes a lot of time. If you check the website the latest article was added 5 months ago. I have all of the articles since then I just haven’t processed them yet.          current working approach:                  get news article link          go to the link          grab the URL, title, headline, author, date of publication, and the content                          I found a script that helps with grabbing all of this (similar to how some browsers allow you to have a read an html page in plain text if you click a button)                                put this stuff into postgres db          index title and content using elasticsearch          for each residence search against this text                    unfortunately it is not done as I cannot narrow down some edge cases.      and what am I up to now?  job search          After 2 years and some, I think it is time as there aren’t any new opportunities for growth as a software engineer where I am      The work moved to a new physical location that is more challenging to commute to      My school debt is causing me a lot of stress and anxiety… so I’d like to pay this off faster.      I am not being paid what I know I could be for someone with my needed skills                  I stayed because of the team but that recently got dissolved                      cspray  dailyvibes          add user auth functionality on ios                  make user auth functionality work between ios and server          make a sync mechanism between ios and server (probably manual for now and then automate)                    modify the way you share links within iOS (add a new area so it is easier to share)                  share these links from iOS to server (after the user stuff is linked up)                    provision a server on DO or Linode                  glue the backend &amp; frontend on this server          glue the server to dailyvibes domain                      elderoost          finish news article parser      add a notifyer after this is done to manually review      figure out monetization      … in that order I think.Now, I’m going to spend the next little while grinding cracking the coding interview bible and all of the typical hackerrank websites.

And if I am being completely honest, I kind of lost steam in March. (To give you some context, I started thinking about the project in October and working on it last November. Since November I tried to ship something every 2 weeks.)Everything was fine until about March. In March, I felt that I did not like where I was going, I was having a bad time, and I was losing project’s direction. I even had thoughts of abandoning it.I also knew that my app was stable enough for people to use. Thus, if I was about to abandon my work then at least people would not lose their data. These thoughts allowed me to slow down and to reflect. Afterall, I still care about the project.Whenever I start thinking this way about a project, I become aware that it is a good time to step back and reflect. In other words, it is a good time to see if my time is worth investing into a project.To start, I wanted to figure out what was causing me to feel this way. I narrowed it down to the following three issues:1. I was facing technical issues.As I work solo, I did not want to spend my limited time on things that do not move the project forward (in the users eyes). But, it got to a point where I needed to eat that frog. It is one of the challenges that comes with indie work. You wear many hats. You are playing the role of a product manager and have to decide on what to work on. Sometimes you have to do the work that you do not want to.2. I was not happy with the direction of the project.At the beginning of the project, I needed to do some market research. I needed to check if this project was worth my interest and time. How did I do my market research? Well, it was very simple. I downloaded all the productivity / todo apps from the Apple App Store and I played with each one of them. I noted down ideas that I liked and things that I did not like. But, by doing that, my phone looks like this now:After playing with each app, I’ve come to realize that most of the apps do the same thing.What this means to the users is that they have a lot of choice in this saturated category of productivity. In otherwords, they can switch from my product much easier.What this means to me is that I don’t need to stress on competing. I was aligning dailyvibes with other similar apps. This process made me bored and stopped using the app. Dailyvibes started because I was not happy of the solutions. Instead I will focus on building features that will be useful to the end user and to me. I will focus on the product and its quality.So I took a step back and recorded the actions that I do every day. I interact with the following data structures: tasks to complete today, notes/text snippets, links/bookmarks, gifs / images and photos. One thing that kind of doesn’t fit is positive thoughts / quotes. I need to think some on this.So I will work on integrating these things into dailyvibes and thus forcing me to dogfood my own app. What will make all these things work together is some kind of linking mechanism. I will definitely polish this as time moves on.After all, users have so much choice.3. I did not know what direction Apple will take Mac OS apps in.The next biggest feature for dailyvibes is to create a server component. Which will be then followed by a syncing mechanism of some sort between the server and iOS app. Both of these components, would position me well to create either a a desktop companion app or a web app. I chose to wait until June to make this decision because of WWDC.I could not decide if I wanted to leverage the iCloud ecosystem and have apple do all the legwork or me. I’ve investigated both options. I decided to roll out my own for three reasons:  I know how,  I want to practice for my personal project, and  I want to have control over my data.I hope that these decisions will also benefit the users.I also could not decide if I wanted to spend time on a native Mac desktop app or on a web app. I am familiar with web but I am very new to the Mac. I investigated both options. I am deciding, at least for now, to focus on the web app component because I am more familiar with that. Plus, Apple admitted that there will be changes to Mac OS next year. I’ll revisit native Mac app next year.It is nice to step back and reflect on how far you’ve come with a project. It is good to be mindful. Albeit, I will be first to admit that it is challenging to talk about your project when it is not going as you expect. I am, once again excited, to keep working on the project and I have a better vision moving forward.This is a nice feeling when you are happy with your decisions. Also, the organic discovery isn’t that bad either:If you’re making something, you have to be the first to believe in success of your thing. Do one thing every day that moves the project forward. Everything else will [hopefully] work itself out.Thanks for reading and until next time,AlexPS: You can download Daily Vibes by searching using your favorite iOS device on Apple App Store or from https://dailyvibes.ca.",

I decided to roll out my own for three reasons:</p><ol>  <li>I know how,</li>  <li>I want to practice for my personal project, and</li>  <li>I want to have control over my data.</li></ol><p>I hope that these decisions will also benefit the users.</p><p>I also could not decide if I wanted to spend time on a native Mac desktop app or on a web app. I am familiar with web but I am very new to the Mac. I investigated both options. I am deciding, at least for now, to focus on the web app component because I am more familiar with that. Plus, Apple admitted that there will be changes to Mac OS next year. I’ll revisit native Mac app next year.</p><hr /><p>It is nice to step back and reflect on how far you’ve come with a project. It is good to be mindful. Albeit, I will be first to admit that it is challenging to talk about your project when it is not going as you expect. I am, once again excited, to keep working on the project and I have a better vision moving forward.</p><p>This is a nice feeling when you are happy with your decisions. Also, the organic discovery isn’t that bad either:</p><p><img src=\"https://d.pr/i/MLstRV+\" alt=\"Q1 results\" /><img src=\"https://d.pr/i/dHUliO+\" alt=\"Q2 results\" /></p><p>If you’re making something, you have to be the first to believe in success of your thing. Do one thing every day that moves the project forward. Everything else will [hopefully] work itself out.</p><p>Thanks for reading and until next time,</p><p>Alex</p><p>PS: You can download Daily Vibes by searching using your favorite iOS device on <a href=\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/id1332324033\">Apple App Store</a> or from <a href=\"https://dailyvibes.ca\">https://dailyvibes.ca</a>.</p>",

How about your father? sister? brother? wife? husband? fiancé? grandparents? neighbour?And I can immediate hear some of you say:  But Alex … you would say …  … they would never use my software… they are not my target audience  Or… I would teach them how to use my software properly.  Or… I would never let them use it.To you, my dear friend, I would ask that you play along with me in this exercise.Suppose that the use of your software became mandatory. Suppose your friend or family member had no help or training from you. Suppose they were that user number #1110101 that you did not want to deal with. Take your pick.  Are you following along?If you are following, at what I am trying to say here, then I hope you can answer yes to my original question with some degree of confidence.And no… you cannot use the typical engineering answer of “it depends”. Sorry, I want a binary response here: yes or no.So, if your answer is a no then I hope that you might start thinking about these important issues. For example, you could start thinking about why are you leaning towards no? Perhaps, what can you do today to increase your level of confidence? Because you can.Do you call yourself a scientist or an engineer? Do you have some variation of this title? Are you proud to call yourself that? Does it define who you are on a day-to-day basis? If so then you must think about ethics. It is your duty.But maybe this belief is naive? Maybe this is not how it works in the real world? Maybe being associated with those things is not enough for such heavy consideration? Maybe we should leave ethics to someone else? We make software to solve some problem and that’s that.Too often I see the answer that it is not applicable to me or my work. Too often I see ambivalence and lack of professional care. To me, this cannot be the winning formula moving forward.If you’ve been following software development for the past few years, then you’ve noticed a certain trend by now. A trend of malpractice if you will. Followed by a trend of acceptance or standardization towards such malpractice. And if you dig a little deeper into these trends — they are often, but not always, connected to some lapse in ethics.And if you’re of the mind that ethics and business [and software] cannot mix — I call for you to reconsider and have a conversation. I hope the pressure of shareholders and funding money does not blind your mission or your vision. Try to figure it out.  Just because you can do something, should you?  If you should, then how can you do so while being ethical?  If you cannot remain ethical, then the least you can do is own it. Don’t deny it. You are a professional, aren’t you?Perhaps our approach to ethics needs a pivot?  Maybe ethics, as a field, is too broad of a topic? Too abstract and not applicable?  Maybe, it is time to reframe our delivery on ethics?  Time to step back and reduce the scope so that we can understand better?So here is me — trying to do that for you. Next time you are working on software just give it a shot and ask yourself this relatable question:  would you let your _ use your software?I’ll let you fill in the blank. Don’t be lazy and do make it relatable.Think about it because your answer should be yes with some level of confidence. It is 2018 and I am trying to take a gradual approach to this topic.We are use a lot of software every single day.  And guess what?It is only the beginning.Just wait until the entire planet, and everyone on it, gets a reliable high speed connection. It is not if but when.Thank you for reading.Sincerely,Alex  PS: I know that I am throwing generalities and I hope you can forgive me for the point that I am trying to illustrate.  PPS: Sorry for the clickbait title — but how else am I going to get you to read about software ethics? Not trying to single out mothers or family members or friends.

SimulatorStatusMagic is used to create the perfect status bar:  9:41 AM is displayed for the time  The battery is full and shows 100%  On iPhone: The carrier text is removed, 5 bars of cellular signal and full WiFi bars are displayed.  On iPad: The carrier text is set to “iPad” and full WiFi bars are displayed.The text above is taken verbatim from the library’s description.Why would you want to do that?Well, such attention to detail adds extra value to your product by making your marketing material that much better than your competition. If you take a second to scan the Apple App store, the top apps provide some level of consistency in their marketing material. It follows, you should work towards achieving a similar level of consistency because it is not really not that hard. And if you set this up once, it will work.So, I wanted to the improve the screenshots that I use to market Daily Vibes in my next update.What did I try?Installed SimulatorStatusMagic using cocoapods by adding the following line to my Podfile, like this:pod 'SimulatorStatusMagic', :configurations =&gt; ['Debug']Next, I found the following two articles and they gave me good starting points. They were perfect for me because I wanted to use flags in my code like this:This would allow me to only import SimulatorStatusMagic during fastlane.tools run.And, I also envisioned using this one flag throughout other areas of the code.So… putting it all together, I wanted something like this:  But, I could not get it to run exactly like that 😭I really wanted to get this to work. However, as a result of these issues you need some tweaking in 2018.So what is my curent solution?  import SimulatorStatusMagic  leverage snapshot’s launch arguments - FASTLANE_SNAPSHOT is set to true  call in code as you wantedif NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults().boolForKey(\"FASTLANE_SNAPSHOT\") {...  SDStatusBarManager.sharedInstance().enableOverrides()  setupScreenshotData()...}And the code above works … but I will be first to admit that it is not the perfect solution.As it is currently written, you will need to play the commenting game:  comment out import SimulatorStatusMagic and  comment out SDStatusBarManager.sharedInstance().enableOverrides()during regular development and do the reverse during fastlane.tools run.So… during regular development:and … during fastlane.tools run:As I am familiar with Ruby and Swift, and can get by with Objective-C, I tried to make it work how I wanted and find the source of confusion. I did look at the xcodebuild arguments and scanned fastlane.tools source code up to here. But, since there is only so much time in the day and I work on this during my free time - I did not narrow down the problem.So if you have a different solution that allows me to run the code how I wanted, please reach out to me via twitter. I will gladly adjust this article to incorporate those changes.Otherwise, I hope that you enjoy this working solution. I was puzzled during my research in 2018 and I did not see a solution so hopefully this helps someone in upping their screenshot game.Thanks for reading,AlexNote: This article was also published on LinkedIn",

            "summary": null,
            "content_text": "Hi friend, is your app running a bit slow? Are you, perhaps, unsure what to do about it? Where do you start to investigate? Perhaps, like me, you started searching 🕵️‍️ in your code for something evident? (Only to realize that you are going down a never ending rabbit hole?)Well, stress not my friend because Xcode got you covered ✅ and it will help you find your issues (or put you on the right track at least).This is a second article that I am writing about an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The more that I use Xcode, the more I like it 😎 Xcode is really, really awesome. Just give it a try and use it.  Side note: it only took me 182 hours to get to the Instruments panel.I’m actually really surprised at the amount of tooling that is given to you in this wonderful IDE. My software engineering training gave me my introduction to IDEs via Eclipse and NetBeans. I’ve spent years using those tools (and don’t get me wrong, they are powerful). But to be completely honest, to this day I will pick anything else but these two. They are ugly, clunky, and not intuitive 🌶Why did I type that paragraph above?Because if you have an aversion to IDEs and think that Xcode looks just like the other IDEs, then I am here to tell you that it really is not. Xcode IS a pleasure to use and I use it every day. (PS: If you are getting angry while reading this and saying !?Xcode sucks!? Don’t get so upset. I will admit, it is not perfect.)InstrumentsIt is this powerful thingy, built on top of DTrace, that comes with Xcode. No need to install extra software. Just download Xcode once and you have everything you need. Don’t have internet connection or you don’t want to be connected? No worries, you can still DO your work.Oh yeah… I used this wonderful youtube video to get an introduction to Instruments. Apple ofcourse has their own documentation which you can get here.The following text is basically my brief overview of Instruments.When you open Instruments, it looks like this:You can launch Instruments like this:Or like this:(I didn’t want to leave you waiting while my slow computer takes its time to compile and open up… but you get the idea)What you do next is kind of interesting. All of the icons that you see above represent the different kinds of tool that you can run on your application. (I think of this screen as a collection of apps for your app). Hopefully you will understand why I say on your application.Out of all of the available options, I’ve only gotten familiar with Activity Monitor, Allocations, Leaks, and Time Profiler. Oh yes, not only are these tools wonderful but the naming conventions are intuitive and grouped by colour. Amazing.Activity Monitor and Time Profiler are in blue. These blue thingys are used to monitor CPU stuffs.Allocations and Leaks are in orange. These orange thingys are used to monitor memory stuff. (Guess what this other orange Zombies thingy looks at? Did you guess RAM stuffs? Cool right!!!)You might be wondering to yourself… all of these thingsys are cool sounding, so what? What do I do with them? Well the cool thing about these thingys is that you can just JUMP in and you will figure things out as you go. It is that easy.I suggest that you play with the other tools available. I am going to focus on the Time Profiler for the rest of this article.

            "content_html": "<p><img src=\"https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/eVxYjd\" alt=\"Image for the post\" /></p><p>Hi friend, is your app running a bit slow? Are you, perhaps, unsure what to do about it? Where do you start to investigate? Perhaps, like me, you started searching 🕵️‍️ in your code for something evident? (Only to realize that you are going down a never ending rabbit hole?)</p><p>Well, stress not my friend because Xcode got you covered ✅ and it will help you find your issues (or put you on the right track at least).</p><p>This is a second article that I am writing about an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The more that I use Xcode, the more I like it 😎 Xcode is really, really awesome. Just give it a try and use it.</p><blockquote>  <p>Side note: it <em>only</em> took me 182 hours to get to the Instruments panel.</p></blockquote><p>I’m actually really surprised at the amount of tooling that is given to you in this wonderful IDE. My software engineering training gave me my introduction to IDEs via <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/ide/\">Eclipse</a> and <a href=\"https://netbeans.org/\">NetBeans</a>. I’ve spent years using those tools (and don’t get me wrong, they are powerful). But to be completely honest, to this day I will pick anything else but these two. They are ugly, clunky, and not intuitive 🌶</p><h2 id=\"why-did-i-type-that-paragraph-above\">Why did I type that paragraph above?</h2><p>Because if you have an aversion to IDEs and think that Xcode looks just like the other IDEs, then I am here to tell you that it really is not. Xcode <em>IS</em> a pleasure to use and I use it every day. (<em>PS</em>: If you are getting angry while reading this and saying <strong>!?Xcode sucks!?</strong> Don’t get so upset. I will admit, it is not perfect.)</p><h2 id=\"instruments\">Instruments</h2><p>It is this powerful thingy, built on top of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTrace\">DTrace</a>, that comes with Xcode. No need to install extra software. Just download Xcode once and you have everything you need. Don’t have internet connection or you don’t want to be connected? No worries, you can still DO your work.</p><p>Oh yeah… I used <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_SOYcYBnGU\">this wonderful youtube video</a> to get an introduction to Instruments. Apple ofcourse has their own documentation which you can get <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/InstrumentsUserGuide/index.html\">here</a>.</p><p>The following text is basically my brief overview of Instruments.</p><p>When you open Instruments, it looks like this:</p><p><img src=\"https://d.pr/i/c280xV+\" alt=\"Xcode Instruments\" /></p><p>You can launch Instruments like this:</p><p><img src=\"https://d.pr/i/QiJqRR+\" alt=\"Opening Xcode instruments open\" /></p><p>Or like this:</p><p><img src=\"https://d.pr/i/PtBZgx+\" alt=\"Opening Xcode Instruments\" /></p><p>(I didn’t want to leave you waiting while my slow computer takes its time to compile and open up… but you get the idea)</p><p>What you do next is kind of interesting. All of the icons that you see above represent the different kinds of tool that you can run on your application. (I think of this screen as a collection of apps for your app). Hopefully you will understand why I say <em>on</em> your application.</p><p>Out of all of the available options, I’ve only gotten familiar with Activity Monitor, Allocations, Leaks, and Time Profiler. Oh yes, not only are these tools wonderful but the naming conventions are intuitive and grouped by colour. Amazing.</p><p>Activity Monitor and Time Profiler are in blue. These blue thingys are used to monitor CPU stuffs.</p><p>Allocations and Leaks are in orange. These orange thingys are used to monitor memory stuff. (Guess what this other orange Zombies thingy looks at? Did you guess RAM stuffs? Cool right!!!)</p><p>You might be wondering to yourself… all of these thingsys are cool sounding, so what? What do I do with them? Well the cool thing about these thingys is that you can just JUMP in and you will figure things out as you go. It is that easy.</p><p>I suggest that you play with the other tools available. I am going to focus on the Time Profiler for the rest of this article. At this point in the learning, I found it to be the most useful for me.</p><p>Time Profiler - I’ve been using this for…profiling… time? 🤷‍ Basically, I open it up and it looks like this:</p><p><img src=\"https://d.pr/i/yRulLi+\" alt=\"Time Profiler in Xcode\" /></p><p>You might be asking, now what?

I figured I would add value to the software as I go. In retrospect, it was a good decision because it allowed me to find value quicker (as opposed to when I was working on the app under wraps).After listening to some feedback on IndieHackers I decided to start working on ASO (Apple Store Optimization). Signed up for Apple’s Ads. Signed up for their Affiliate program. Started researching.What I have learned so far:  Title matters  Description matters  Keywords matter  Having screenshots ??? apparently matters  Having a video ?? apparently matters  Description and other stuff that you have to fill in… doesn’t matterWhat else I have learned?  What you actually put in any of those fields doesn’t really matter. Don’t get attached to your App name, App Description, Keywords or anything else to do with it. This is important for indie developers with no ad budget. Why? Because we want to be found so people use our software.  If you have a budget then you can pick your Branding carefully and you can ignore what I said above  So, while working on improving Daily Vibes I am also looking at improving my overall marketing. I am going to do it iteratively and learn along the way.What is my plan of attack?  improve title (Daily Vibes ➡️ Daily Vibes: Life Task Manager)  improve subtitle (Todo List &amp; Life Day Organizer ➡️ To do list, life day organizer)  improve keywords; currently haven’t decided:  to-do, list app, list maker, task list, todo list, list, task, todo, to do, life organizer, daily  todo,list,organizer,tracker,task,project,things,productivity,to do,to-do,keep,reminder,day planner  life organizer, good vibes, daily tasks, daily office, daily calender,daily lists, daily organizer, lists maker,  make screenshots localized with pretty text (via fastlane.tools) … something like:  make AND edit AND upload a video  improve aforementioned screenshots  improve aforementioned videoAll of these ideas are up in the air while I am writing this post. I am hoping to ship them with next release, hopefully sometime next week. Then, I will have to wait and look at the analytics.ConclusionA lot of work goes behind the scenes for a single app. I am beginning to appreciate indie developers and their successful products. You really need to be comfortable with wearing ALL of the hats that make a successful business.For me, marketing is an uncharted area and I was hesitant to start learning it. But look at me now, I can make icons, promo videos, and start being strategic about growth. It is a journey that I am enjoying but it is challenging.I also paved the road and did all of the necessary paper work to add in app subscriptions. Now I just gotta figure out my strategy in this area ;)Oh and in closing news, I wanted to keep to a somewhat relaxed 2 week shipping cycle… and so far I have been sticking to the schedule of regular updates =) I hope I can keep this up!Download Daily VibesThank you for reading and until next time my friend.Sincerely,Alex",

I figured I would add value to the software as I go. In retrospect, it was a good decision because it allowed me to find value quicker (as opposed to when I was working on the app under wraps).</p><p>After listening to some <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/show-ih-daily-vibes-ios-80a69b4368\">feedback on IndieHackers</a> I decided to start working on ASO (Apple Store Optimization). Signed up for Apple’s Ads. Signed up for their Affiliate program. Started researching.</p><h3 id=\"what-i-have-learned-so-far\">What I have learned so far:</h3><ul>  <li>Title matters</li>  <li>Description matters</li>  <li>Keywords matter</li>  <li>Having screenshots ??? apparently matters</li>  <li>Having a video ?? apparently matters</li>  <li>Description and other stuff that you have to fill in… doesn’t matter</li></ul><h3 id=\"what-else-i-have-learned\">What else I have learned?</h3><ul>  <li>What you actually put in any of those fields doesn’t really matter. Don’t get attached to your App name, App Description, Keywords or anything else to do with it. This is important for indie developers with no ad budget. Why? Because we want to be found so people use our software.</li>  <li>If you have a budget then you can pick your Branding carefully and you can ignore what I said above</li></ul><blockquote>  <p>So, while working on improving Daily Vibes I am also looking at improving my overall marketing. I am going to do it iteratively and learn along the way.</p></blockquote><h3 id=\"what-is-my-plan-of-attack\">What is my plan of attack?</h3><ul>  <li>improve title (Daily Vibes ➡️ Daily Vibes: Life Task Manager)</li>  <li>improve subtitle (Todo List &amp; Life Day Organizer ➡️ To do list, life day organizer)</li>  <li>improve keywords; currently haven’t decided:</li></ul><blockquote>  <p>to-do, list app, list maker, task list, todo list, list, task, todo, to do, life organizer, daily</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>todo,list,organizer,tracker,task,project,things,productivity,to do,to-do,keep,reminder,day planner</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>life organizer, good vibes, daily tasks, daily office, daily calender,daily lists, daily organizer, lists maker,</p></blockquote><ul>  <li>make screenshots localized with pretty text (via <a href=\"fastlane.tools\">fastlane.tools</a>) … something like:</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://d.pr/i/LcaVFa+\" alt=\"LocalizedScreenshot sample\" /></p><ul>  <li>make AND edit AND upload a video</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://d.pr/i/cmP5EE+\" alt=\"Video WIP Screenshot\" /></p><ul>  <li>improve aforementioned screenshots</li>  <li>improve aforementioned video</li></ul><p>All of these ideas are up in the air while I am writing this post. I am hoping to ship them with next release, hopefully sometime next week. Then, I will have to wait and look at the analytics.</p><h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3><p>A lot of work goes behind the scenes for a single app. I am beginning to appreciate indie developers and their successful products. You really need to be comfortable with wearing ALL of the hats that make a successful business.</p><p>For me, marketing is an uncharted area and I was hesitant to start learning it. But look at me now, I can make icons, promo videos, and start being strategic about growth. It is a journey that I am enjoying but it is challenging.</p><p>I also paved the road and did all of the necessary paper work to add in app subscriptions. Now I just gotta figure out my strategy in this area ;)</p><p>Oh and in closing news, I wanted to keep to a somewhat relaxed 2 week shipping cycle… and so far I have been sticking to the schedule of regular updates =) I hope I can keep this up!</p><p><a href=\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/id1332324033?mt=8&amp;at=1010lK7Y\">Download Daily Vibes</a></p><p>Thank you for reading and until next time my friend.</p><p>Sincerely,Alex</p>",

If you don’t want to or don’t have time to learn about Core Data then you can just jump to that website. Follow it. And it will just work.This way, you can add those things in the future. So just plan for it.Also, noticed that some tutorials are suggesting to ship the app with things like subscription services and such to be turned on. Just turned on and not active. This way you can add it whenever you want it but you went through review already. Or maybe you just don’t have the time and want to follow good practices.

I succeeded in achieving both of those goals.Be ProactiveMy first goal, was to be more proactive in my ideas. In other words, I wanted to stop dreaming about solutions and to take action on those ideas.How did I approach this?Well, for starters, that meant that I had to get into the habit of writing down every new idea. Regardless of the idea and its feasibility. It did not matter what state I was in, where was I, or what I was doing. I wrote everything down and I dated it. Writing things down removes extra load from your beautiful brain and puts the ideas into a specific place. And guess what? You know exactly where that place is and you can reference it at any time.Dating my ideas came as an after thought. Once my list began to grow and get out of hand, I realized that I needed some structure and cohesion. By now, dating new ideas is second nature by now and I quite enjoy it.Document All The ThingsThe other goal for 2017 was to be more deliberate in my software development process. I wanted to be more deliberate in the ways that I approach software engineering. At the end of the day, I want to practice what I preach. I began to document how I plan, brainstorm, document, and iterate on my ideas. There is much more than that, but this was a good start.What did this entail?Since I am very much inspired by fellow indie developers, I began searching for strategies. I wanted to discover where everyone hangs out. I wanted to go there and hang out with them. I wanted to give back and participate. I wanted to learn from them. With them.Not the successful and loud ones. Everyone. And I came to the conclusion that what they do is exactly what I want to do. They want to better their process and their product. How do they do that? By being “transparent” about what they do and how they do it.Don’t dwell on the transparency word. What I mean by that is that there is a certain amount of magic in proclaiming a public goal and then working towards achieving that goal.Documentation plays a big part of this. How? Well, if I make a public goal and everyone sees that I am working towards achieving that goal then an interesting thing happens. First, you get motivated to keep working on that goal. Second, you get immediate feedback from the world. Which bring me to the third point. You need to respond to that feedback and have a conversation. Behind those cat avatars and pseudonyms, on the Internet, are real people with real opinions and thoughts.This process of using social media requires you to actually USE it.So, where is this rambling of mine taking me? Towards my goal for 2018 of course. I want to document things more in the open. I mean, I already do this work for myself so I might as well share it with you.In the process, I hope to share whatever I find useful with fellow developers and to better my communication skills through it. If you cannot tell from this article, I tend to ramble a lot. Two academic degrees will do that to you. I mean, that research article or lab report isn’t going to write itself 🙉So, this is why I resurfaced my blog and re-added my previous entries. This is my commitment to documenting all of the things. I hope these will be more frequent. At least for 2018. I hope that you will enjoy this adventure because I will.",

            "content_text": "First and foremost… I like experimenting with different OS environment just so I stay familiar. Besides having Windows, CentOS, and Ubuntu running on my computer, I decided to give OS X another try.Computer Hardware:  Intel Core 2 Duo E8400  Gigabyte GA-P31-DS3L Motherboard  Nvidia GTS450 Graphics card  4 gb DDR2 Ram (667 MHz)As you can see, my hardware is ‘old’ by today’s standards. However, I try to get the best bang for my buck without upgrading. I only upgrade my hardware when something fails. It has been working well so far. My computer is on 24/7/365 except for random reboots and power outages. I’ve had this PC on 24/7 since 2008. I’ve had it on 24/7/365 since 2010. I am on my second motherboard (lan failed on first one), second CPU cooler (by choice), and a 3rd GPU. This CPU is amazing.I have not installed OS X after purchasing a new graphic card Nvidia GTS450 earlier this year. I had an old 8600GTS before this graphic card. The prior graphic card had no problem with running OS X 10.6.I decided to give the hackintosh project a shot. I installed OS X 10.6 at first. However, I noticed that my GTS450 was not being recognized. I did perform several troubleshooting steps. After searching for a bit, I found out that GTS450 support improved as of 10.7. At this point, I was debating on whether or not to install 10.7 or to jump to 10.10.I decided to jump to Yosemite 10.10 after reading the tonymacx86 forums. A number of users reported successful bootings with Fermi graphic cards. I used my macbook to download the upgrade and make a bootable USB. The system did not boot until I added the following flags:GraphicsEnabler=Yes, PCIRootUID=1, npci=0x2000You can find out what each of these flags does here. After the inital install everything booted smoothly. I then ran MultiBeast. I followed the specifications for my motherboard and installed the appropriate drives. Everything worked after a restart. However, I noticed that my system experienced random freezes.There did not appear to be any pattern to the cause of the freeze. The freezing began by not responding to any key presses or mouse clicks. However, I was able to move the mouse across my dual screen setup. After some time, the mouse cursor finally disappeared from the display(s). The system then gives a black screen and instantaneously brings the Yosemite login screen. Upon entering my password and loading Yosemite, the bug report displayed a problem with my graphic card. I spent a few hours looking for a solution.Rather than troubleshooting a graphic card that is not natively supported by Apple (yet? will it be?), I am leaning towards upgrading my graphic card. I had previous problems with the graphic card. It is not able to support my two monitors at the maximum resolutions. I am really pushing its performance when I am editing images. Therefore, I am leaning towards upgrading my graphic card.Ultimately, I am going to purchase a graphic card that brings my hardware closer to the Mac specifications outlined by Apple AND drives my two monitors easily (at max. resolution).In conclusion, this group of people has done a fantastic job in easing the installation of OS X on any Intel-based hardware. Their guides are phenomenal. The difference between installing OS X 10.6 and 10.10 is night and day. It used to take me hours (or days) to research, prepare, compile, and install - took me a few hours for 10.10.Not only do I have a working OS, but I also have a fully bootable USB that can be natively plugged into any Intel-based machine.

Besides having Windows, CentOS, and Ubuntu running on my computer, I decided to give OS X another try.</p><p>Computer Hardware:</p><ul>  <li><a href=\"http://ark.intel.com/products/33910/Intel-Core2-Duo-Processor-E8400-6M-Cache-3_00-GHz-1333-MHz-FSB\">Intel Core 2 Duo E8400</a></li>  <li><a href=\"www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=2615&amp;kw=GA-P31-DS3L\">Gigabyte GA-P31-DS3L Motherboard</a></li>  <li><a href=\"http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814500187\">Nvidia GTS450 Graphics card</a></li>  <li>4 gb DDR2 Ram (667 MHz)</li></ul><p>As you can see, my hardware is ‘old’ by today’s standards. However, I try to get the best bang for my buck without upgrading. I only upgrade my hardware when something fails. It has been working well so far. My computer is on 24/7/365 except for random reboots and power outages. I’ve had this PC on 24/7 since 2008. I’ve had it on 24/7/365 since 2010. I am on my second motherboard (lan failed on first one), second CPU cooler (by choice), and a 3rd GPU. This CPU is amazing.</p><p>I have not installed OS X after purchasing a new graphic card <a href=\"http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814500187\">Nvidia GTS450</a> earlier this year. I had an old 8600GTS before this graphic card. The prior graphic card had no problem with running OS X 10.6.</p><p>I decided to give the <a href=\"http://tonymacx86.com/\">hackintosh project</a> a shot. I installed <a href=\"http://tonymacx86.blogspot.ca/2010/04/iboot-multibeast-install-mac-os-x-on.html\">OS X 10.6</a> at first. However, I noticed that my GTS450 was not being recognized. I did perform several troubleshooting steps. After searching for a bit, I found out that GTS450 support improved as of 10.7. At this point, I was debating on whether or not to install 10.7 or to jump to 10.10.</p><p>I decided to jump to <a href=\"http://www.tonymacx86.com/445-unibeast-install-os-x-yosemite-any-supported-intel-based-pc.html\">Yosemite 10.10</a> after reading the tonymacx86 forums. A number of users reported successful bootings with Fermi graphic cards. I used my macbook to download the upgrade and make a <a href=\"http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads.php?do=file&amp;id=249\">bootable USB</a>. The system did not boot until I added the following flags:</p><pre><code>GraphicsEnabler=Yes, PCIRootUID=1, npci=0x2000</code></pre><p>You can find out what each of these flags does <a href=\"http://www.tonymacx86.com/basics/104536-troubleshooting-issuing-boot-flags.html\">here</a>. After the inital install everything booted smoothly. I then ran <a href=\"http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads.php?do=file&amp;id=252\">MultiBeast</a>. I followed the specifications for my motherboard and installed the appropriate drives. Everything worked after a restart. However, I noticed that my system experienced random freezes.</p><p>There did not appear to be any pattern to the cause of the freeze. The freezing began by not responding to any key presses or mouse clicks. However, I was able to move the mouse across my dual screen setup. After some time, the mouse cursor finally disappeared from the display(s). The system then gives a black screen and instantaneously brings the Yosemite login screen. Upon entering my password and loading Yosemite, the bug report displayed a problem with my graphic card. I spent a few hours looking for a solution.</p><p>Rather than troubleshooting a graphic card that is not natively supported by Apple (yet? will it be?), I am leaning towards upgrading my graphic card. I had previous problems with the graphic card. It is not able to support my two monitors at the maximum resolutions. I am really pushing its performance when I am editing images. Therefore, I am leaning towards upgrading my graphic card.</p><p>Ultimately, I am going to purchase a graphic card that brings my hardware closer to the Mac specifications outlined by Apple AND drives my two monitors easily (at max. resolution).</p><p>In conclusion, <a href=\"http://tonymacx86.com/\">this group of people</a> has done a fantastic job in easing the installation of OS X on any Intel-based hardware. Their guides are phenomenal. The difference between installing OS X 10.6 and 10.10 is night and day. It used to take me hours (or days) to research, prepare, compile, and install - took me a few hours for 10.10.</p><p>Not only do I have a working OS, but I also have a fully bootable USB that can be natively plugged into any Intel-based machine.
