How to make this work?

```shell
node code.js <args>
```

You don't need to import anything. Open a new file and start coding.

Node's core provides a `process` object that exposes `process.argv` property. This has what we need. This property exposes an array. First two items in the array are :

- `process.argv[0]` - location of node and
- `process.argv[1]` - location of the script being executed, respectively.

The entries after, `process.argv[2...process.argv.length]`, will be used for user input arguments.

You can get to them like this :

```js
// code.js
const args = process.argv.slice(2);

args.map((arg) => {
  console.log(arg);
});
```

Then re-run the program again and terminal will print out the arguments one at a time; like this :

```shell
$ node code.js user:alice password:onetwothreefourfice
> user:alice
> password:onetwothreefourfice
```
