Those of you that know me personally, know that I do a lot of little experiments and I like to reflect. I believe in engineering and science principles. They are at my core and drive me forward.

Unfortunately, I feel like I am not doing a good job in reflecting and sharing that with you. What happens usually is that I open up a blank canvas, such as this one, and just start writing. Usually I have a topic or a direction that motivates me to write. However, I do not consider if I will publish or delete the content at the time of writing it.

This is what I mean by a blank canvas in September 2018:

So I have a lot of written content spread out around various computers, domains, and publications. A lot of this content is not published and, if taken out of context, may seem like a waste of my time. Personally, it is very difficult to hit that publish button for many reasons.

To me, writing is cathartic in a sense &mdash; the single purpose is to remove the content from my head. When it is out of my head then I can play with it. In my head there is chaos, so I like to consolidate my ideas and to make sense of them. To tease out my views and opinions (and to correct them).

If you take this into consideration, then perhaps you can see why some of my pieces don't get my approval and thus never see the light. However, the longer I live on this earth, the more I wish I didn't hold back and just publish (whether or not it is finished). So, I decided to actively work on this.

One of my goals for 2018 was to publish more frequent written updates. The intention was not only to improve the quality of my written content but also to documenting a process.

_It is the end of September. Month #9 is almost done. So how have I been doing?_

On the whole, I have been doing way better than any of my previous years. If you take a look at this year alone, I have published 11 pieces of work so far. Some of them even required a lot of additional work. Gasp!!! One thing for sure &mdash; I have been staying consistent. Whatever that means to me.

If I take a look at it this way, then my progress is happening. I am growing and developing. However, during my day-to-day thinking it feels more negative. I feel like I could be doing better in this area. I still find myself falling into the trap of not publishing. Reflecting on this progress definitely helps to stay on track.

So, I think I am doing OK even if it doesn't feel like that. I give myself the permission to make mistakes, publish more frequent and unfinished work; and continue this journey that I started.

And for those of you that finished reading this, here is some context. Here is an example of a written piece that I ended up [publishing](/blog/would-you-let-your-mother-use-your-software): (start in [Hemingway app](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) and then I perform my transformations if approved)
