I learned recently : if I am procrastinating then I may have a challenging problem somewhere that I am avoiding.

I tend to be pretty good at knowing when I procrastinate. Certain habits or certain rituals -- I just know that I am procrastinating.

For me, it gets tricky when procrastinating is me working on a personal project. I like creating; it keeps me busy; and I am following my passions. How can that be procrastinating!? Some activities do not seem like a procrastinating activity at first.

So instead of being mad at myself for procrastinating I started to ask myself why I am procrastinating. As a result, this enables me to :

1.  catch myself in the middle of procrastinating
2.  figure out what it is that I am avoiding
3.  decide if to continue procrastinating

Procrastination doesn't have to be negative.
