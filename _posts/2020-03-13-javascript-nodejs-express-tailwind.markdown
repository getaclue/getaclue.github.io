In this article I will show you how to install [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/) for use in a basic [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) app. This nodejs project had no other dependencies as I just wanted to install [tailwindcss].

After initializing the [expressjs] project, I added a folder that would host my stylesheet :

```

mkdir -p ./public/stylesheets
```

After that, I created two stylesheet files. One will hold the source code for my styles, and the other one is the output that will be generated by [tailwindcss].

```

touch ./public/stylesheets/source.css
touch ./public/stylesheets/style.css
```

Now, install the [tailwindcss] :

```js

# Using npm
npm install tailwindcss

# Using Yarn
yarn add tailwindcss
```

Open your recently created `source.css` located in `./public/stylesheets/source.css` and add the [tailwindcss] injections :

```

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Then you want to generate your `style.css` file so you can actually use in your project. Simply use [npx] and generate the file.

```

npx tailwindcss build ./public/stylesheets/source.css -o ./public/stylesheets/style.css
```

Voila! You have installed [tailwindcss]. Now simply go into the file that hosts your layout for the project and add the stylesheet in your header

```

<link rel='stylesheet' href='/stylesheets/style.css' />
```

I also added this command to my `package.json` and made it look like so :

```

"scripts": {
    "start": "npm build:css && node ./bin/www",
    "build:css": "npx tailwindcss build ./public/stylesheets/source.css -o ./public/stylesheets/style.css"
  },
```

Optionally, if you would like to add extra configurations to your [tailwindcss] setup, you can initialize a settings file via [npx]:

```

npx tailwindcss init
```

This will create `tailwind.config.js`.

```

// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {},
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
```

There you go, [tailwindcss] in your basic [expressjs] project in 5 minutes.
