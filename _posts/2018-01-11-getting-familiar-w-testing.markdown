This will be a quick post, mainly a reference to some resource I've been using to get familiar with iOS testing and refactoring.

Refactoring is fun because I get to exercise my software engineering muscles. This is one of the reasons that I like Swift so much. I get to apply my software engineering knowledge on my own projects üëè

Testing on the whole is not difficult in iOS. However, when you add things like CoreData then it becomes a bit more chaotic to filter through.
