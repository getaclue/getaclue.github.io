# What I’m doing now

<em>
(This is <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">a now page</a>, and if you have your own site, <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">you should make one</a>, too.)

This page was mostly inspired by [https://sivers.org/now](https://sivers.org/now).

## Living in Hamilton, Canada

I've been living in Hamilton since July 2019.

~~Living in Toronto, Canada~~

~~I've been living in Toronto since June 2017. I fell in love with the city and the people. We are looking to move in the near future to help with our living arrangments and bigger projects that need more space.~~

## Upcoming Near Future

Expecting to become a more familiar face in the Hamilton scene by attending events.

~~Expect not to reach me from the last week of May 2019 and until second week of June 2019. Taking a much needed off-line experience to cope with terrible burn-out I've experienced in April 2019.~~

## Working Day time

I am working on contract for Statistics Canada. <mark>I am open to long term opportunities in Hamilton / Toronto / GTA</mark>.

## Work After hours

We are focusing on [lastminutelaura.ca](https://lastminutelaura.ca) and [yt.com/lastminutelaura](https://youtube.com/lastminutelaura) growth.

~~Soon, I am hoping to bring my iOS app -- [dailyvibes.ca](https://dailyvibes.ca) -- to a stable environment with added search and monthly subscriptions. Also, I am waiting for the marzipan announcement from June 2019 WWDC to plan my expansion into the desktop space. I am also planning to release a sync feature of some sort for the fall 2019 school year.~~

## Best way(s) to reach me

My most frequented social media platform of choice is [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexkluew). If you want something more direct, I am also on [Telegram Messenging Platform](https://t.me/getaclue).
