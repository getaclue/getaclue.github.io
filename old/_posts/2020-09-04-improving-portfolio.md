I feel like having your own portfolio on the web is a must for a software craftperson. I think that the old way of not needing a portfolio is not going to last.

If you want to compete for a remote position or have an online business, you need a portfolio of your work and services. The portfolio is a way to show your customer why they should pick you.

## What is a portfolio ?

To me, this website is my portfolio.

It is a collection of works and description of those works.

## Problem(s)

One of the challenges with having the portfolio is knowing what to put on it. After all, the portfolio is a public. Another challenge is to know what level of details to put into the descriptions. Who is the target reader? Does that matter?

For my portfolio, I started it all with a blog. As time went, and I developed skills, I added a projects section. I tried to explain each project via the technologies used, screenshots, and live links. I do not think that my descriptions fit my portfolio anymore. The projects page has become more than a wall of text.

## Solution

Now, it is time to improve my portfolio and add a case study section. This section will allow me to expand on each project in a systematic way. I will explore examples of case studies and then apply the approach to my projects.

At the moment, I will be incorporating [this guide](https://designthings.fun), for emerging designers today, to my ~~website~~ porfolio.

I will be using ~~three~~ one of their checklists

1. ~~One for the entire website~~
2. One for a case study section on the website
3. ~~One for website presentation~~

I am excited to be exploring the case study improvement to my portfolio. I plan to do a retro on each of the closed projects and talk about them in depth.

## tl;dr

Portfolios are important and work on them never ends. I will be adding case studies. Maybe.
