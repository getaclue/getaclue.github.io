Like I mentioned before, I understand the subject matter but not as deep as I would like to.</p><p>So, I began by looking backwards: I wanted to figure out during which course I was introduced to them first. I knew that it was around first or second year; and I knew that it was in Calculus. I did not remember if it was Calculus I or Calculus II. I could not remember but why struggle when you can look this up? Since my degree is from an accredited institution that provides accredited degrees — I can simply request this information or look it up. All of the courses and their description is fully published at uOttawa so this took me a few minutes.</p><p>Turns out it was first introduced to me during Calculus II. While I didn’t have my notes, I did recall which textbook I used to study and I recall exactly where we studied this. I did have the textbook so I just went ahead and looked it up. And then everything clicked in for me — I figured out how I got confused around series and sequences.</p><p>It was precisely in Chapter 8 of this (not) so wonderful <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Single-Variable-Calculus-published-Hardcover/dp/B00E27YJ0E">textbook</a> by James Stewart. Why do I say not so wonderful? Because, looking on the order of topics presented in retrospect, sequences, series, and limits of these things were introduced at the same time. What I did not realize when I was younger — professors usually follow a textbook for their instructions. So, if the textbook does not match your studying techniques then the way the knowledge is delivered via professor will not aid.</p><p>Sequence is introduced as:</p><blockquote><p>A sequence can be thought of as a list of numbers written in a definite order …</p></blockquote><p>Ok good I can follow that. One thing that should have been bolded, in my opinion, was the <em>definite order</em> part of the definition but it was not. Right after the definition, we were shown three ways of describing a sequence:</p><blockquote><p>… one by using the preceding notation, another by using the defining formula, and a third by writing out the terms of the sequence …</p></blockquote><p>Ok, even though I’ve never seen this before presented like this I can follow along. Then they moved to describing how you could find such a description on your own via an example:</p><blockquote><p>… [n]otice that the numerators of these fractions start with 3 and increase by 1 whenever we go to the next term. The second term has numerator 4, the third term has numerator 5; in general, the nth term will have numerator n + 2. The denominators are the powers of 5,</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>… so an has denominator 5n. The signs of the terms are alternately positive and negative, so we need to multiply by a power of 1. In Example 1(b) the factor … meant we started with a negative term. Here we want to start with a positive term and so we use …</p></blockquote><p>Looking at it now — there is a lot going on above and definitely went above my head when I was introduced OR I did not understand it. But that was not the culprit — you can get by just fine with not understanding this.</p><p>On the same page we get some new examples of sequences that is introduced as</p><blockquote><p>… sequences that don’t have simple defining equations</p></blockquote><p>Boom. Problem 1 — sequences don’t have simple defining equations. That is such a subtle and non-bolded way of describing an important property of sequences. But don’t worry, as you keep reading this example, one sub-example at a time, you come to the famous Fibonacci sequence that everyone loves to introduce.</p><p>And how do they introduce this example? Using limits ofcourse. This is calculus afterall. This was Problem 2 for my understanding. These two problems are the reasons where everything went downhill. The text went on to the properties such as convergence and divergence and others. Nowhere, was there a connection of some sort to series.</p><p>This is what I mean</p><p><img src="/assets/images/2018-10-16/fibonacci-sequence-introduction.png" alt="Fibonacci sequence" /></p><p>And how was a series introduced?</p><blockquote><p>What do we mean when we express a number as an infinite decimal? For instance, what does it mean to write…</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>… The convention behind our decimal notation is that any number can be written as an infinite sum. Here it means that…</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>… where the three dots … indicate that the sum continues forever, and the more terms we add, the closer we get to the actual value of pi.</p></blockquote><p>Does it make sense to you if you were seeing this for the first time? It did not for me. If you keeping reading there <em>is</em> a mention of a connection between a sequence and a serience</p><blockquote><p>… Thus the sum of a series is the limit of the sequence of partial sums. …</p></blockquote><p>so I cannot say that the author did not connect the ideas. But I can say that it was not clear for me then. When you combine the idea that the textbook was not helpful, the speed at which education moves, and a teacher that follows the book without helping you — you move on and keep going. Obviously I adapted and learned, otherwise I would not have graduated magna cum laude.</p><p>This whole thing was pretty surreal for me and super exciting. Not only did I narrow down my confusion surrounding sequences and series but I also uncovered the exact point where I got confused. Anywho, I’m going to continue studying my weak areas so that I can improve my analysis of algorithms. I think that I am pretty good but I want to be better.</p><p>Originally I was going to write about something else but this experience was more exciting for today.
