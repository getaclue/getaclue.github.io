            My name is Alex. I am currently studying at the <a href="http://www.uottawa.ca/academic/info/regist/1314/calendars/programs/1209.html">University of Ottawa</a> as a Software Engineering student.
          </p>

            I have a B. Sc.
            in Psychology. My honours thesis was "An fMRI investigation of working memory in chemotherapy-treated breast cancer patients".
            I have also taken numerous 2nd and 3rd year Chemistry classes while I was debating
            my transfer into a software engineering field.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, once I transfered into software engineering, I have not looked back.

            My current interests are in the area of web development.
            I like the idea of using a tool regardless of the device and operating
            system. I believe that the user experience for your tool should be
            identical on all platforms and devices.

            I like knowledge. I try to explore the various branches of knowledge in order to understand our ever-changing world. Also, I find information security and cyber security extremely important. I try follow these topics (and many other) on the daily basis via
            twitter and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">hacker news</a>.
