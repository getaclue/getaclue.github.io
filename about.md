# Hello friend!

Welcome to my little corner of the Internet. This place is my collection of things that I wanted to share. It is my own long-term social experiment. As all things go on the internet, unless mentioned otherwise, content that you may find here is not affiliated with my work or employer.

## Quick about me:

- Software Engineer, <a href="http://peo.on.ca/index.php?ci_id=2064&la_id=1" title="The Engineering Intern (EIT) Program">EIT</a>
- live and work in beautiful [Toronto, Canada](https://www.toronto.ca/)
- work for ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ on contract
- hold two complementary undergraduate degrees awarded from [University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/en):
  - [BASc in Software Engineering](https://www.uottawa.ca/academic/info/regist/1516/calendars/programs/1459.html)
  - [Honours BSc in Psychology](https://socialsciences.uottawa.ca/programs/undergraduate-course-sequences/honours-bsc-psychology)
- _open to new opportunities in Toronto or remote_ <a href="mailto:info@getaclue.me?subject=Available%20Opportunity%20in%20Toronto%20or%20remote" title="hire me">hire me</a>
- life-long interest in software engineering discipline
- [resume](https://getaclue.github.io/files/Mar-17-2019-Resume_Public.pdf)

## Technology I am familiar with:

I am always learning and experimenting on my own time. My computer science foundation, coupled with software engineering training, allows me to jump into any code base and any language.

- been enjoying Swift lately
- computer science foundation using Java and C
- familiar with Ruby (Ruby on Rails, Sinatra)
- familiar with Javascript (React, React Native, Ember, ES2016, ES2017, and ES2018)
  - familiar with jQuery [but I prefer to use Javascript](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) nowadays
- familiar with HTML
- familiar with CSS/SASS/Less
- familiar with multi-language and accessibility compliance
- familiar with cross-platform development
- familiar with cross-browser development
- familiar with continuous deployment (codeship, travis, jenkins)
- familiar in \*nix environments
- ~~competent in Swift~~
  - able to work with Objective-C
- new in iOS development (since November 2017)
- new in OS X development (since April 2018)

I am open to learning new technology.

## Long about me:

Hello, friend. Alex here. I am a software engineering graduate living in Toronto, Canada. I graduated magna cum laude from [University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/en). I mention this because it means a lot to me. I was afraid of the challenges that come with completing an engineering degree curriculum. It took a lot of effort and hard work.

I am interested in all aspects of the software engineering discipline. To prove my dedication beyond obtaining an accredited software engineering degree, I am in the process of obtaining my [professional engineering (P.Eng) license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_and_licensure_in_engineering#Canada_2). I am currently in the <a href="http://peo.on.ca/index.php?ci_id=2064&la_id=1" title="The Engineering Intern (EIT) Program">EIT</a> stage. As it is illegal in Canada to call yourself a Software Engineer without an engineering license, hopefully this shines some light on any confusion around my _Software Engineer, <a href="http://peo.on.ca/index.php?ci_id=2064&la_id=1" title="The Engineering Intern (EIT) Program">EIT</a>_ title.

My career path has not been so straightforward. You can check out my [resume](https://getaclue.github.io/files/Mar-17-2019-Resume_Public.pdf) to see my adventures. The common denominator along all my various career paths has been people. I enjoy helping people and businesses solve their problems. I strive to leave whatever I work on in a better state than I found it. My life's goal is to be helpful to people by being great at creating and maintaining usable software.

## Other interests

As you know, I also have a degree in Psychology. I went into the degree without any interest and with the single goal of applying to medical schools. I stayed to learn about people. My honours thesis was _"An fMRI investigation of working memory in chemotherapy-treated breast cancer patients"_. I was interested in Neuroscience and was given an opportunity to work with [fMRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging).

I enjoy knowledge for its own sake. I explore other disciplines to understand our ever-changing world. Also, I use such opportunity in attempts to connect different disciplines to software. The future of software lies in cross-disciplinary solutions.

I am also interested in business and entrepreneurship. Here is a video of my adventures during the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/business-and-economy/start-summer-company-students">Ontario Summer Company 2014 Entrepreneurial Grant</a>:
