# Hi Stranger!

## My name is Alex. 

- üè° and ‚öí in Toronto
- üíñ [Laura](https://www.instagram.com/lauraandalex_vlog/)
- working on contract for üá®üá¶

I have two undergraduate degrees and they are complementary. I live in Toronto, Canada. 
I recently (June 2017) moved here from Ottawa with my fiance. I graduated from University of Ottawa with a Software Engineering Degree. I like Toronto very much.

I am interested in software engineering as a discipline. To prove my dedication, I am in the process of applying and obtaining my [P.Eng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_and_licensure_in_engineering#Canada_2). I am currently in the [EIT](http://peo.on.ca/index.php?ci_id=2064&la_id=1) stage and I cannot wait to be licensed.

I have a B.A.Sc. in Software Engineering.

I have a B.Sc. in Psychology. My honours thesis was "An fMRI investigation of working memory in chemotherapy-treated breast cancer patients".
I have also taken numerous 2nd and 3rd year Chemistry classes while I was debating
my transfer into a software engineering field.

However, once I transfered into software engineering, I have not looked back.

~~My current interests are in the area of web development.~~ Update (01/2018): My interest may be changing. I am really enjoying Swift but this does not mean that I do not like web stuff.

I believe in the idea of using a tool regardless of the device and operating system. I believe that the user experience for your tool should be identical on all platforms and devices. (I used to have hope and was excited for [Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) but not any longer.)

I like knowledge. I try to explore the various branches of knowledge in order to understand our ever-changing world. Also, I find information security and cyber security extremely important. I try follow these topics (and many other) on the daily basis via twitter, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">hacker news</a>, and other sources.

I am interested in entrepreneurship. Here is a video of my adventures during the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/business-and-economy/start-summer-company-students">Ontario Summer Company 2014 Entrepreneurial Grant</a>:

### Recruiter?
Thank you for stumbling upon me and reading this far. If I am looking for a job, then the following information may be useful for you. If I am not, then this is purely here for documentation.

#### What should you know about me?
- I like to work
- I don't like to waste time (yours or mine)
- I prefer to ask why not instead of why
- I chose the software engineering profession for a reason
- I like to think about software from the initial idea all the way to maintenance stage (or "end" if you like) [psych training surely complements engineering here]

#### Why should you hire me?
- I am reliable and honest
- I listen to feedback and improve based on comments
- I learn quickly
- I care

#### What am I good at?
- I will find a solution for whatever problem that is at hand or die trying
- I want everyone to succeed, thus I will provide honest advice
- I like performing under stress

#### What am I bad at?
- sometimes my solutions are complex
- sometimes I struggle communicating complex ideas in easy to understand and digest words (one of the reasons behind this website ü§™)

#### What can I do for you?
- Give me 3 months and some tasks and see where this leads us
- I promise to give my best shot
- If it does not work out, no hard feelings
