Hi there!

My name is Alex. I am currently studying at the [University of Ottawa](http://www.uottawa.ca/academic/info/regist/1314/calendars/programs/1209.html) as a Software Engineering student.

I have a B. Sc.
in Psychology. My honours thesis was "An fMRI investigation of working memory in chemotherapy-treated breast cancer patients".
I have also taken numerous 2nd and 3rd year Chemistry classes while I was debating
my transfer into a software engineering field.

However, once I transfered into software engineering, I have not looked back.

My current interests are in the area of web development.
I like the idea of using a tool regardless of the device and operating
system. I believe that the user experience for your tool should be
identical on all platforms and devices.

I like knowledge. I try to explore the various branches of knowledge in order to understand our ever-changing world. Also, I find information security and cyber security extremely important. I try follow these topics (and many other) on the daily basis via
twitter and [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com).

Here is a video of my adventures during the [Ontario Summer Company 2014 Entrepreneurial Grant](https://www.ontario.ca/business-and-economy/start-summer-company-students):
