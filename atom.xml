   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;option-2&quot;&gt;Option 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the unknowns that comes with being a business owner and a freelancer is your cashflow. You may not know if work will be there next month. Thus, making your cashflow more predictable is a necessity for the longevity of the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/2020-09-05/artem-beliaikin-Dz-Iij3CrpM-unsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Getting paid as a freelancer&quot; style=&quot;border-radius:10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few different ways that you can get paid as a freelancer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Money upfront before work begins&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/Y money upfront before work begins&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/X money per submitted feature (project divided into number of features)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No money upfront before work begins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about cashflow is one of those things that gives me stress and anxiety. I started to pay attention to this recently. Given my experience and my portfolio I have been using option 2 for new projects. I don’t think I will be using that moving forward. I will be moving to a model combination of 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beyond-option-2&quot;&gt;Beyond option 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option 2 is not ideal for my productivity and mental health. It causes stress that is not necessary to a project. When I am working on a project, I want to focus on the project and not on checking how many hours I clocked. This is not to say that I came to this conclusion out of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried both options 3 and 4, and I do not like that type of business exchange. It does not create a dedicated relationship between the two parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;success-of-a-project&quot;&gt;Success of a project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A project requires team mates. From my experience, the best output comes from a team where everyone has equal input. How can I, as a contractor, form this business relationship with our client? I know that money exchange is a challenging subject for everyone. During the initial transaction, solidify that and get it out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;initial-transaction&quot;&gt;Initial transaction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that a client has money set aside for a project. I know that they need an outside professional to help them build their vision. I know that the world has many professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Client is thinking of hiring me because I am a professional and because they selected me among many. There will be a discussion about rates. This is where marketing skills come into play. Both businesses want an equal exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that when presenting them my their pricing options I cannot mention stress or anxiety. Those factors are part of business and everyone experiences them. However, I can mention my productivity and project commitment. I can mention that I work better when I don’t have to think about the cashflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;money-exchange&quot;&gt;Money exchange&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money exchange, to me, is a commitment from both sides to be business team mates and to see this project into fruition. From my side, when I receive the money, I agree to set time aside and dedicate it to this project. I agree to be engaged in the success of the project. When the client sends the money, I gain trust in the client’s trust in me as a professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-if-they-dont-like-it&quot;&gt;What if they don’t like it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you need to be in a position where you can present options 1 and 2. How to test this out? If you are asking this question, you are not there yet. If you are new, you can join something like Upwork and try your pitches on projects with your current portfolio and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I said that the client has money set aside for the project. Well, if they do not or if their cashflow is variable then this response will be an indicator of that to me. At which point I will decide if I want to take this client on or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more work than there are workers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Improving Portfolio</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/improving-portfolio"/>
   <updated>2020-09-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/improving-portfolio</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I feel like having your own portfolio on the web is a must for a software craftperson. I think that the old way of not needing a portfolio is not going to last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to compete for a remote position or have an online business, you need a portfolio of your work and services. The portfolio is a way to show your customer why they should pick you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-portfolio-&quot;&gt;What is a portfolio ?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, this website is my portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a collection of works and description of those works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problems&quot;&gt;Problem(s)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges with having the portfolio is knowing what to put on it. After all, the portfolio is a public. Another challenge is to know what level of details to put into the descriptions. Who is the target reader? Does that matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my portfolio, I started it all with a blog. As time went, and I developed skills, I added a projects section. I tried to explain each project via the technologies used, screenshots, and live links. I do not think that my descriptions fit my portfolio anymore. The projects page has become more than a wall of text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it is time to improve my portfolio and add a case study section. This section will allow me to expand on each project in a systematic way. I will explore examples of case studies and then apply the approach to my projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I will be incorporating &lt;a href=&quot;https://designthings.fun&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt;, for emerging designers today, to my &lt;del&gt;website&lt;/del&gt; porfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2020-09-04/design-things.png&quot; alt=&quot;designthings.fun&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be using &lt;del&gt;three&lt;/del&gt; one of their checklists&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;One for the entire website&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One for a case study section on the website&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;One for website presentation&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am excited to be exploring the case study improvement to my portfolio. I plan to do a retro on each of the closed projects and talk about them in depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tldr&quot;&gt;tl;dr&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portfolios are important and work on them never ends. I will be adding case studies. Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Task Management Strategy</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/task-management-strategy"/>
   <updated>2020-08-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/task-management-strategy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I’ve tried many different approaches to managing my life and the tasks that I have to do. One thing is certain for me: keeping all the tasks in my head does not work long-term. Moreover, as I add more tasks, it becomes impossible to remember all the details of each task in my brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This used to ding my confidence as I thought that I could keep everything in my head. I saw no need for a system or a process for my task management. I thought that a task management system is something that you use for work and not for personal success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know about biases and that while it may be true that I am good at remembering my tasks, I can always experiment and get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t found a perfect solution that is digital or analogue. I switch between the two or complement digital with analogue (and vice versa). Commonly, I have a notebook near my reach and using Notes app on my Mac and iPhone. Regardless of the medium that I use, I ALWAYS date my tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had an experiment from March to May 2020 where I went back to using simple paper post-it notes and nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-std.droplr.net/files/acc_603419/NlqD8C&quot; alt=&quot;Post it notes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the post-it notes system was a visual and physical process. I could use post-it’s colours to separate, categorize, or group ideas. Post-its allowed me to glue important tasks to my monitor for visibility. I could spread my post-it cards and view my ideas on any physical surface. I thought I found a perfect system and was feeling productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These paper post-its were helpful in keeping my thoughts in line while I was writing my first book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://learnnodejs.dev&quot;&gt;Learn Node.js&lt;/a&gt;. I had an idea for the book but ideas for chapters and their structure were less clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had two post-it piles : to finish and finished. Every idea went into to finish pile. This pile would then grow and I would feel less anxious. In the individual post-it card, I was as descriptive as I could be about a task. The physical constraint of the post-it paper made sure that I was succinct. Then, as I progressed through my tasks I would cross out completed items and move them into the completed pile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, I would reward myself twice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(1) for completing a task by crossing it off and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(2) for placing a post-it card onto the completed pile and making the pile grow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the post-it solution for tracking my life tasks died down around May 2020 when I completed my &lt;a href=&quot;https://learnnodejs.dev&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;. I could not get into the habit of using post-it notes for everything else in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve been keeping important tasks in my head once again. I finally caught myself in this bad loop. I know that keeping things in my head for a long time leads to burnout. Now, I am trying to offload these things and get back into order. After post-its, I was using a combination of Apple Notes and physical paper for managing my global tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that post-it solution works great for short-term. It failed to captivate me in the long-term. Physical transport of the cards was a big let down. As my list of post-its grew, it became not realistic to carry the pile with me. While in transit, I found myself using the Notes app and not a post-it even if I had them with me. The paper can be lost, whereas my data in the app will stay there. This method fell short as I would fail to transfer data from the note’s app into its own post-it when I was at home. I did not like the need for double processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want from my task management process is to see my progress and to keep track of tasks. I think the best way to approach this problem for me is to separate the year into 52 weeks and 12 months. Then for each week separate it into 7 days. Finally, for each day track the tasks added and completed. The following day, move tasks that were not completed from one day to the next. Group all this by months. Ideally this process is digital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am trying &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so&quot;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt; application to envision my described perfect task management process. I tried to use Trello before Notion but I could not reproduce the functionality. Notion made realizing my idea easier to do. I made my application look like this :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-std.droplr.net/files/acc_603419/37AlCw&quot; alt=&quot;notion application folder format&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, the system breakdown looks like :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[month #] &amp;gt; [week #] &amp;gt; [day #] &amp;gt; [task(s)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals of system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Streamline my productivity and increase positivity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduce daily stress and anxiety&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduce reliance on my brain and offload data to an app&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use it for short-term and long-term task management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rules of system :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;System depends on daily active use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the morning, copy the data of previous day to the new day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Delete completed tasks from previous day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go over the tasks in the To Do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Move tasks I think I will work on today to the top of the To Do list&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Throughout the day, I add tasks as needed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Throughout the day, offload an idea from my head by creating it into a task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risks :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If my to do list gets huge I can see myself being overwhelmed and stop using the system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reliance on Notion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not sure how to archive progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Nodejs: Accept arguments from cli</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/nodejs-accept-arguments-from-cli"/>
   <updated>2020-08-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/nodejs-accept-arguments-from-cli</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How to make this work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;node code.js &amp;lt;args&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to import anything. Open a new file and start coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Node’s core provides a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;process&lt;/code&gt; object that exposes &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;process.argv&lt;/code&gt; property. This has what we need. This property exposes an array. First two items in the array are :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;process.argv[0]&lt;/code&gt; - location of node and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;process.argv[1]&lt;/code&gt; - location of the script being executed, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entries after, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;process.argv[2...process.argv.length]&lt;/code&gt;, will be used for user input arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get to them like this :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// code.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;argv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then re-run the program again and terminal will print out the arguments one at a time; like this :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;node code.js user:alice password:onetwothreefourfice
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; user:alice
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; password:onetwothreefourfice
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem solved 👍&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Walking Away</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/walking-away"/>
   <updated>2020-08-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/walking-away</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the past few days, I have been writing on productivity and/or lack of it and I figured I would continue the thought process today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I have a hard time with pausing and walking away from one project when time is up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get caught up in the flow of the making process that, when the time comes, it makes switching to a different task appear to be a net negative. This is regardless of what the next task may be. My mind plays this trick on me saying that the flow state will not happen again today. Whereas, I know for a fact that one can get back into the flow state through patience, practice, and repetition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why a net negative? I know that if I keep working on a task after the allocated time then I move away from productivity zone into the procrastination zone. I am doing busy work and ignoring work. In the immediate, I become happy to be creating but in the long-term I would prefer to walk away from the project and spend my time differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, I sometimes lose productivity by NOT walking away from working on a project. Breaking this rule is O.K. but I have to be aware of consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This becomes challenging when sticking to a strict, self-imposed schedule. I am much better with a fluid schedule that I fill in after the fact. A schedule is supposed to help me plan out my days and not cause anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am trying to bring more positivity into my life. I am increasing my positivity by being conscientious about my days. By procrastinating and not walking away from a project, I gain a negative feeling as I reflect on the activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this hiccup and stick to schedules better, I am trying to be more deliberate in my productivity strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when it is time to take a pause from a task, I note anything that is unfinished as pending items in my global list of tasks. If I have a large task, I write a summary so that recall is better when I re-read it. I know that my future self will thank me for writing things down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is okay to take a pause and walk away. There will always be more work.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Coherent Thoughts</title>

   <updated>2020-08-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/coherent-thoughts</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I find it hard to keep my thoughts coherent and focused on a single task for a fixed amount of time. What happens in my mind is that my brain puts all tasks at the same importance level. Then my mind brings those tasks to my attention as I am chugging away at a task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it becomes challenging to context switch. I do not know how to treat a task as more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I do switch from a task to another task, my mind begins to worry about not working on a different task. This becomes a negative loop of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I get into this mode, I spend chunks of time switching between different tasks. I spend time worrying and being anxious. However, not much gets accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing things down and creating smallest accomplishable tasks appear to aid in escaping this terrible mode.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On procrastination</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/on-procrastination"/>
   <updated>2020-08-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/on-procrastination</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I learned recently : if I am procrastinating then I may have a challenging problem somewhere that I am avoiding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to be pretty good at knowing when I procrastinate. Certain habits or certain rituals – I just know that I am procrastinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, it gets tricky when procrastinating is me working on a personal project. I like creating; it keeps me busy; and I am following my passions. How can that be procrastinating!? Some activities do not seem like a procrastinating activity at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of being mad at myself for procrastinating I started to ask myself why I am procrastinating. As a result, this enables me to :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;catch myself in the middle of procrastinating&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;figure out what it is that I am avoiding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;decide if to continue procrastinating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procrastination doesn’t have to be negative.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Self-publishing a technical book</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/self-publishing-technical-book"/>
   <updated>2020-04-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/self-publishing-technical-book</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I began to write my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Learn Node.js&lt;/code&gt; (working title) book last month. It is a self-published book project. The aim of the book is to help developers, switching to javascript and node.js, to hit the ground running by building and uploading a functional project. By going through the book you will be able to build features that modern javascript applications require.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current plan is to self publish and I will be doing that using &lt;a href=&quot;https://gumroad.com/&quot;&gt;gumroad&lt;/a&gt;; then I will upload a copy on iBooks store; and checkout amazon’s self publishing via kindle. In all three scenarios, a pdf output of the book is perfect. So, the final version of my book will be available for purchase in at least the pdf format. &lt;a href=&quot;https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/&quot;&gt;Asciidoc&lt;/a&gt; documents are perfectly converted to pdf format using &lt;a href=&quot;https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-pdf/&quot;&gt;asciidoctor-pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began writing my book using iBooks Author authoring tool with the intention of publishing the book on the iBooks store. However, as I progressed in my writing process, I realized that my book contained quite a bit of code blocks. I wrote about this &lt;a href=&quot;./asciidoc-vs-ibooks-author&quot;&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt; but I ended up fully re-doing my work and switching away from iBooks Author authoring tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite honestly, lack of beautiful code blocks (once converted to pdf) is why I switched my writing into &lt;a href=&quot;https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/&quot;&gt;asciidoc&lt;/a&gt; format. For images, so far I have been fortunate to use a combination of screenshots and adobe photoshop software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more involved diagrams, I opted out to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://plantuml.com/&quot;&gt;plantuml&lt;/a&gt; for diagram creation. It works pretty good and allows you to maintain your images in plain text format for backups or quick adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a few hours killing time by working on the book cover marketing material. I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freepik.com/&quot;&gt;https://www.freepik.com/&lt;/a&gt; to have many wonderful book cover mockups for free. There are also paid alternatives. Point is… finding a beautiful cover may take some time =)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;write using &lt;a href=&quot;https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/&quot;&gt;asciidoc&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/&quot;&gt;vs code&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asciidocfx.com/&quot;&gt;asciidocfx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;convert &lt;a href=&quot;https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/&quot;&gt;asciidoc&lt;/a&gt; to pdf using something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-pdf/&quot;&gt;asciidoctor-pdf&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asciidocfx.com/&quot;&gt;asciidocfx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To publish the pdf book on &lt;a href=&quot;https://gumroad.com/&quot;&gt;gumroad&lt;/a&gt; one just needs to make an account.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To publish the pdf book to iBooks, one needs to connect your iCloud, in iTunes Connect, to Apple Books &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201183&quot;&gt;like so&lt;/a&gt;. And then you need to download iTunes Producer to upload your book to their store&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To publish the pdf book to Amazon, one needs an amazon account and then head over to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US&quot;&gt;kindle direct publishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turns out, to &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.leanpub.com/en/articles/2921549-what-formats-do-leanpub-books-come-in&quot;&gt;publish&lt;/a&gt; the pdf book on &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/&quot;&gt;leanpub&lt;/a&gt; one just needs an account &lt;del&gt;Oh yes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/&quot;&gt;leanpub&lt;/a&gt; is another option if you would like to stick to markdown and not interested in learning the power of &lt;a href=&quot;https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/&quot;&gt;asciidoc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy writing!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Asciidoc vs. iBooks Author pdf output</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/asciidoc-vs-ibooks-author"/>
   <updated>2020-04-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/asciidoc-vs-ibooks-author</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wanted to spend some time today on giving the &lt;a href=&quot;https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/&quot;&gt;asciidoc&lt;/a&gt; format a try. I’m currently working on a book in iBooks Author and previewing the work as a pdf. The goal of this book is to be viewed the best in the pdf format. As far as I could tell, iBooks Author, does a good job on doing what I want it to do. However, formatting the code blocks takes some time and it looks a bit odd on the pdf output. Well, to be honest it doesn’t look that great as an epub either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way that I currently work is that I open &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/&quot;&gt;vs code&lt;/a&gt; to the specific code file that I am talking about in the book and copy that code. When I switch to the iBooks Author I paste the copied code by right clicking in the section to be pasted and selecting “Paste and Retain Style” option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this does is preserves the styles, font, and formatting of my code just like it was in &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/&quot;&gt;vs code&lt;/a&gt;. This works well and would have no issues if I wanted my code in this book to look like regular text. I want the code blocks to stand out and be formatted differently. To do that I change the font background color and format each code block one line at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the iBooks Author the formatting of the code blocks looks good :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2020-04-13/ibooks-author-view.png&quot; alt=&quot;iBooks Author.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues arise when I export the project in any of the available formats. In the epub format and in the pdf the code block lines are processed with a small white border or spacing. Thus, the beautiful black background and the formatted code is viewed with white spacing in between each line. This makes the code blocks somewhat ugly and not exactly viewed how they are in the authoring tool. This is what the book looks like when opened in iBooks :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2020-04-13/ibooks-view.png&quot; alt=&quot;iBooks view&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and this is what a pdf output looks like :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2020-04-13/pdf-view.png&quot; alt=&quot;pdf view&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I found out about a different authoring tool, or I should say a different way of writing the book using &lt;a href=&quot;https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/&quot;&gt;asciidoc&lt;/a&gt; formatting language. The format is in plain text, which is awesome and requires no proprietary tool to create. However, it takes a little bit of time to get used to it. I spent two hours today redoing one of the sections of my book into &lt;a href=&quot;https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/&quot;&gt;asciidoc&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to see if there was any difference in the pdf output of the code blocks. Moreover, I wanted to see what options I have for displaying code in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, the pdf output looks pretty good and asciidoc format allows for nifty code annotations via numbers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2020-04-13/asciidoc-pdf-view.png&quot; alt=&quot;asciidoc pdf view&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it worth the switch for me at this point in time? No probably not. I am still focusing on the content so the formatting should come after the content. However, I will most likely convert the book from iBooks Author proprietary format to &lt;a href=&quot;https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/&quot;&gt;asciidoc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple’s authoring tool is wonderful if you are just working with text and media. Adding code blocks does not really work out of the box and requires some fiddling. Is it passable output for a selling product? I think so as I am selling content and not formatting. Formatting of the content is just icing on the cake for me. But, if I was starting this project again I would start it in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/&quot;&gt;asciidoc&lt;/a&gt; format for sure. Plus I like having my content in just plain text and not stuck in some proprietary tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are wondering I tried to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asciidocfx.com/&quot;&gt;asciidocfx&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/&quot;&gt;vs code&lt;/a&gt; to code the section. &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/&quot;&gt;VS code&lt;/a&gt; works well, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asciidocfx.com/&quot;&gt;asciidocfx&lt;/a&gt; ‘s preview feature works a bit better. I thought that since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asciidocfx.com/&quot;&gt;asciidocfx&lt;/a&gt; is Java based that it would be slow to use and edit on, but so far so good. I’ll finish by showing what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asciidocfx.com/&quot;&gt;asciidocfx&lt;/a&gt;’s environment looks like :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2020-04-13/asciidocfx-view.png&quot; alt=&quot;asciidocfx view&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Simple Bcrypt ExpressJS example</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/bcrypt-expressjs"/>
   <updated>2020-03-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/bcrypt-expressjs</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wanted to build an &lt;a href=&quot;https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html&quot;&gt;ExpressJS&lt;/a&gt; simple tool that will serve two functions :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;hash a string using bcrypt and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;compare a hashed and plain-text string using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt&quot;&gt;bcrypt&lt;/a&gt; to see if they match.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;justification&quot;&gt;Justification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two features are the building blocks for something like authentication in an app. If I was storing some string in my database, like a password, that I did not want anyone to read, I would have to encrypt the string. Something like bcrypt algorithm is a wonderful tool to do that. In this tutorial, I walk you through the two functions that would save a lot of headaches for you : &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hash&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;compare&lt;/code&gt;. Lets see what I did in the steps below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;limitations-of-bcrypt&quot;&gt;Limitations of bcrypt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting hashes will be 60 characters in length and composed of the following characters :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;./ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-a-new-project&quot;&gt;Create a new project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I created a new project running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm init&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;nodejsprojects
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;bcryptexample
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;bcryptexample
npm init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I downloaded the two minimum dependencies :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;express &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--save&lt;/span&gt;
npm &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;bcrypt &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--save&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implement-bcrypt-in-expressjs&quot;&gt;Implement &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt&quot;&gt;bcrypt&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html&quot;&gt;expressjs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I created my express server with two public resources that process my two wanted functions for this project. The code of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; simply looks like this :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/getaclue/62142f5b829c4594a2f13bff7505f90d.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I launched my project&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;node index.js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and began testing it by navigating to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://localhost:3000/hash/randomstringgoeshere&lt;/code&gt; to see the bcrypt hashed string as output by the server. To test the second function you need to input the hash and plain-text string manually. Like so :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://localhost:3000/compare/&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$2b$10$DB0melt1B&lt;/span&gt;.3Fn7MfXwC17OIevWVhtSgXMrINkg9M4SEHdFgM6Myqm/dasdas
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s it. You now harness the power of using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt&quot;&gt;bcrypt&lt;/a&gt; in your &lt;a href=&quot;https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html&quot;&gt;ExpressJS&lt;/a&gt; projects. Feel free to read the documentations for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt&quot;&gt;bcrypt&lt;/a&gt; to see all of the options and customizations available out of the box. A prime example for using something like the bcrypt library is for password storage in your database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a scenario, after receiving user input of a password, run the text through &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hash&lt;/code&gt; function and then save that string in your database rather than a plain-text password. Next, when you need to check if the encrypted password saved in your database matches a string, run the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;compare&lt;/code&gt; function to check do that check for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are adding authentication or message encrypting to your app, you are already doing some custom coding. So, spend a few moments and make that code secure so that your users have a peace of mind when it comes to storing something sensitive on your app. Just be aware of the limitations of this library.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our goal for this project is to see this :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2020-03-18/goal-sequelize.png&quot; alt=&quot;Connection established.&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start the project by making the src folder :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot; data-lang=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;dev/nodejs
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;LeAppWriteup
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;LeAppWriteup &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; npm init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;install the basic dependencies : express, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/getting-started.html&quot;&gt;sequelize&lt;/a&gt;, and sqlite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot; data-lang=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;npm &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--save&lt;/span&gt; express
npm &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--save&lt;/span&gt; sequelize
npm &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--save&lt;/span&gt; sqlite3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to configure the database connection first, so I made a folder called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;config&lt;/code&gt; and a file for database &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;db.js&lt;/code&gt;. In the file I wrote the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// config/db.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Sequelize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;sequelize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Sequelize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;dialect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;sqlite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;leappwriteup.sqlite3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The configuration above basically follows the readme of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/getting-started.html&quot;&gt;sequelize&lt;/a&gt; project. We are injecting the sequelize project, then we are instantiating a sequelize object that will use sqlite as its database. After this, I was ready to test the connections. All of the basic building blocks are there. The server, the database, and the connector. We test all three by running the following code in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; file (our start file) :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// index.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;express&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;router&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;./config/db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// start db&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;authenticate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Connection established.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Unable to connect to db: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// start app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the code above we are first injecting the dependent packages : express and database, the code for which is from our text above. We then call the database to establish a connection. If everything works as expected I will see &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Connection established.&lt;/code&gt; message. Otherwise, I will see the error for why it did not connect to the db. Finally, the express server is started and the entire app is exported for use elsewhere in the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot; data-lang=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;node index.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node index.js&lt;/code&gt; and see your progress. You should see the successful message. Congratulations, you have connected your server to the database and created an empty &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sqlite3&lt;/code&gt; database file. Otherwise, review your steps or send me a shout ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part is totally optional. To interact with the database, we better start off with modeling our data as per &lt;a href=&quot;https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/getting-started.html&quot;&gt;sequelize&lt;/a&gt; documents. I did it by creating the following file in the folder &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;models&lt;/code&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot; data-lang=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;models
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;models &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;touch &lt;/span&gt;user.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then created the following code in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;user.js&lt;/code&gt; file :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// models/user.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sequelize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;../config/db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;DataTypes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;sequelize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sequelize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;DataTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;STRING&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;allowNull&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;DataTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TEXT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;allowNull&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;DataTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TEXT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;allowNull&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;DataTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TEXT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;allowNull&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, test all of the code together by interacting with the database. I will do so by creating a seed file and running it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot; data-lang=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;touch&lt;/span&gt; ../config/db.seed.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the seed file I want to connect to the database and add one user to the database and save it. After doing that, I want to run my project again to ensure that the connection to the database is established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// config/db.seed.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;./db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;../models/user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;seed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;force&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`M&amp;lt;gC4['Dqv}G''X&quot;Tg4XDbRrmWR46/ca`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;failed to seed, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;seed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once everything is typed out, you can feel free to test everything once again. I ran the follow commands and made sure everything worked as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot; data-lang=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;node config/db.seed.js
node index.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what your final folder structure should look like :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have installed &lt;a href=&quot;https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/getting-started.html&quot;&gt;Sequelize&lt;/a&gt; and SQLite in my ExpressJS project; established the connection between ExpressJS and SQLite via &lt;a href=&quot;https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/getting-started.html&quot;&gt;Sequelize&lt;/a&gt;; created User’s table, added some data, and queried that data. From here on, steps like building out the api; authentication; and authorization can proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What to do before building authentication with ExpressJS app</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This weekend I wanted to play with &lt;a href=&quot;https://tailwindcss.com/&quot;&gt;tailwindcss&lt;/a&gt; and what better way to do it then with a project. My project was going to be simple : &lt;strong&gt;write a tutorial on authentication in nodejs apps&lt;/strong&gt;. And I did complete the project, but I struggled to make it easy as possible to follow. I wrote this just so I could break down the next few entries. I ended up using a few packages that I absolutely couldn’t go without and that added to the scope. I also spent lots of time on research and seeing what is out there :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2020-03-16/lots_of_tabs.png&quot; alt=&quot;lots of tabs&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured that a good post prior to me re-doing the project would be to talk about thinking of authentication. I will be breaking down the project into smaller parts. I figured in this post, I will outline what I am thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;authentication&quot;&gt;Authentication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background-refresher&quot;&gt;Background refresher&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing that I did when beginning the project was go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/&quot;&gt;OWASP&lt;/a&gt; and remind myself of the common pitfalls in authentication, and password storage. After all, if I am putting a tutorial out there I want it to be somewhat secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links used in background refresher:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html&quot;&gt;https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html&quot;&gt;https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html&quot;&gt;https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;decision-time&quot;&gt;Decision time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew that I wanted to store the information in a database. I did not want to rely on a third party service. So, for data processing and database communication I opted for &lt;a href=&quot;https://sequelize.org&quot;&gt;sequilize&lt;/a&gt; package. &lt;a href=&quot;https://sequelize.org&quot;&gt;Sequilize&lt;/a&gt; is great in that you can switch databases and maintain data integrity because you describe all of your data in code in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this tutorial, I wanted to store username, email, and password. I did not want to store the password as plaintext for this tutorial even though I was trying to keep the tutorial simple. My goto solution for password encryption is usually the bcrypt algorithm. So, for this project, naturally, I decided to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt&quot;&gt;bcrypt&lt;/a&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t decide if I wanted to teach about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken&quot;&gt;jwt&lt;/a&gt; tokens or session &lt;a href=&quot;https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cookie-parser.html&quot;&gt;cookies&lt;/a&gt;. Afterall, nowadays you need to be comfortable in both. So, I opted out for storing jwt token in the cookies. Using cookies is usually my default go-to because the technology is proven, safe, and reliable. Cookies have been here since the beginning on web apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as I proceeded through my project, I realized that this went beyond the scope of my initial tutorial. This added a level of authorization to our authentication tutorial. I finished this authorization not realizing that I will have to backtrack in my actual write up and create several tutorials out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-connect-sequilize-to-expressjs-app&quot;&gt;How to connect Sequilize to ExpressJS app&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will talk about the setup of sequilize and a simple model of our user that will be used in follow up tutorials. The user will contain username, password, and email attributes. Maybe… I will add token attribute and confirmation_token attributes for confirmation steps. Haven’t fully decided on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-add-authentication-to-expressjs-app-with-sequilize&quot;&gt;How to add authentication to ExpressJS app with Sequilize&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of my tutorial authentication will be split into : user sign up, user login, and user password reset. I will have to mention about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt&quot;&gt;bcrypt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-add-authorization-to-expressjs-app-with-sequilize&quot;&gt;How to add authorization to ExpressJS app with Sequilize&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this tutorial I will be mentioning the usage of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken&quot;&gt;jwt&lt;/a&gt; and session &lt;a href=&quot;https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cookie-parser.html&quot;&gt;cookies&lt;/a&gt;. These details kind of depend on the clients that will be using our API and whether or not we have an API. I used both to show the different ways of implementing authorization. Personally I prefer cookies as they have been battle tested in various environments, but sometimes for things like mobile apps, you need to use something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken&quot;&gt;jwt&lt;/a&gt;. I simply saved my generated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken&quot;&gt;jwt&lt;/a&gt; token in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cookie-parser.html&quot;&gt;cookies&lt;/a&gt; so that we can play with both :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what it looked like when finished :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2020-03-16/sign_in.png&quot; alt=&quot;sign in&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2020-03-16/sign_up.png&quot; alt=&quot;sign up&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2020-03-16/forgot_password.png&quot; alt=&quot;forgot password&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2020-03-16/profile.png&quot; alt=&quot;profile&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure if I will have this UI for the written up tutorials or if I will come up with something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: When most people think of authentication they actually are referring to authorization. So… you may have to explain this to your client. It is a good idea to have a walk through of the components that you need to build. You can create deliverables out of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example above shows the authorization and authentication of a simple user profile using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken&quot;&gt;jwt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cookie-parser.html&quot;&gt;cookies&lt;/a&gt;. The information is stored in a sqlite3 database in the local directory and is using &lt;a href=&quot;https://sequelize.org&quot;&gt;sequilize&lt;/a&gt; driver for data access. The ui is build using &lt;a href=&quot;https://tailwindcss.com/&quot;&gt;tailwindcss&lt;/a&gt; (I have a tutorial on that tailwindcss which you can visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://getaclue.me/2020/03/13/javascript-nodejs-express-tailwind&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). With the help of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken&quot;&gt;jwt&lt;/a&gt; our software is also ready to create an api for mobile or desktop clients if there was ever a need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was not tracking my time on this but it says I used about 3 hours this weekend in VS Code. Which includes writing in VS Code as well. So maybe divide in half? About 1 hour or 1.5 hours on this code for sure I would think.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to install TailwindCSS in ExpressJS app</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/javascript-nodejs-expressjs-tailwindcss"/>
   <updated>2020-03-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/javascript-nodejs-expressjs-tailwindcss</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this article I will show you how to install &lt;a href=&quot;https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/&quot;&gt;TailwindCSS&lt;/a&gt; for use in a basic &lt;a href=&quot;http://expressjs.com/&quot;&gt;ExpressJS&lt;/a&gt; app. This nodejs project had no other dependencies as I just wanted to install &lt;a href=&quot;https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/&quot;&gt;tailwindcss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After initializing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://expressjs.com/&quot;&gt;expressjs&lt;/a&gt; project, I added a folder that would host my stylesheet :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot; data-lang=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;mkdir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; ./public/stylesheets&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I created two stylesheet files. One will hold the source code for my styles, and the other one is the output that will be generated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/&quot;&gt;tailwindcss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot; data-lang=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;touch&lt;/span&gt; ./public/stylesheets/source.css
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;touch&lt;/span&gt; ./public/stylesheets/style.css&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/&quot;&gt;tailwindcss&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot; data-lang=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Using npm&lt;/span&gt;

npm &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;tailwindcss

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Using Yarn&lt;/span&gt;

yarn add tailwindcss&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open your recently created &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;source.css&lt;/code&gt; located in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./public/stylesheets/source.css&lt;/code&gt; and add the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/&quot;&gt;tailwindcss&lt;/a&gt; injections :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@tailwind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@tailwind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@tailwind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;utilities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you want to generate your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;style.css&lt;/code&gt; file so you can actually use in your project. Simply use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx&quot;&gt;npx&lt;/a&gt; and generate the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot; data-lang=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;npx tailwindcss build ./public/stylesheets/source.css &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; ./public/stylesheets/style.css&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voila! You have installed &lt;a href=&quot;https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/&quot;&gt;tailwindcss&lt;/a&gt;. Now simply go into the file that hosts your layout for the project and add the stylesheet in your header&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;stylesheet&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/stylesheets/style.css&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also added this command to my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; and made it look like so :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;scripts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;start&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;npm build:css &amp;amp;&amp;amp; node ./bin/www&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;build:css&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;npx tailwindcss build ./public/stylesheets/source.css -o ./public/stylesheets/style.css&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optionally, if you would like to add extra configurations to your &lt;a href=&quot;https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/&quot;&gt;tailwindcss&lt;/a&gt; setup, you can initialize a settings file via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx&quot;&gt;npx&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot; data-lang=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;npx tailwindcss init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will create &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tailwind.config.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// tailwind.config.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;variants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you go, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/&quot;&gt;tailwindcss&lt;/a&gt; in your basic &lt;a href=&quot;http://expressjs.com/&quot;&gt;expressjs&lt;/a&gt; project in 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ruby on rails vs change</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/ruby-on-rails-vs-change"/>
   <updated>2020-03-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/ruby-on-rails-vs-change</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a lot to thank for knowing ruby on rails. I wrote the previous article and it sounds so negative whenever I look at it. However, it is not meant to be that way. I was simply saying that I need a change for personal projects. One of the benefits from learning and using the framework has been learning about the internet. So my entire internet foundation and appreciation for it has been in parallel while working on rails. It is challenging to be looking at new tools and replacements for your familiar workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just today, instead of learning something new … I spent the time and put my offline Elderoost project back online, and adjusting to heroku. This included uncoupling the database connectors and elasticsearch setup. My previous version ran on a standalone server. However, I don’t have a spare server running anymore (one of the reasons why project is down) so I put it up on heroku. I did not do a full recovery. For demonstration purposes, I put up 2 sample data points. I just wanted it to function and to showcase the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can visit it here &lt;a href=&quot;https://elderoost.herokuapp.com/?ref=getaclue.me&quot;&gt;https://elderoost.herokuapp.com/&lt;/a&gt;. Just give it a moment for heroku to spin up an instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is much more simple and pleasurable to be doing something known, like putting a ruby on rails project on heroku, rather than learning a new language or framework. In the queue I have python, django, and nodejs. I put nodejs last because I am familiar with node and javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also put up the most recent, version 2, front page for dailyvibes.ca that was offline. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://surge.sh&quot;&gt;surge.sh&lt;/a&gt; for that. And I also found version 1 of the front page, which I put up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://netlify.com&quot;&gt;netlify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailyvibes.surge.sh&quot;&gt;version 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mystifying-franklin-7d7d19.netlify.com&quot;&gt;version 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I have registered on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/~01efcdfcc917b82687/&quot;&gt;upwork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freelancer.com/u/getaclue1&quot;&gt;freelancer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiverr.com/getaclue1&quot;&gt;fiver&lt;/a&gt;. My current tangible goal is to make 600$ usd extra per month. I think the goal is achievable. I have also reached out to my previous freelance employers. I figured I will have to do some leg work on upwork, freelancer, and fiver before I can achieve that number. I am new on those platforms so we will see how it goes. I heard that if you have good reviews, you will get work. So, I need to get some reviews under my belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current plan of attack : look for projects in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Java, and Swift on each platform. Find a posting that I like. Hit submit a proposal and write a proposal with a link back to this website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential employers will come to this website and see some of my work. So, putting Elderoost, dailyvibes version 2, and dailyvibes version 1 back online wasn’t totally a waste of resources for today =)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Five years of ruby on rails</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/ruby-on-rails"/>
   <updated>2020-03-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/ruby-on-rails</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It is fun to be creating in the programming language that is trending. Ruby on Rails was trending among the software craftsperson community throughout the 2010s and in the late 2000s. And I say ruby on rails &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; ruby. Personally, I do not happen to care very much for Ruby. It looks the same as Python and even is written using similar syntax and notation. However, it just so happens that ruby on rails was built using Ruby. It provided quick way to create projects while being the talk of everyone. The most productive framework if you may. Part of the fun was that everyone was creating using it. As a result, you could find people using ruby on rails in many places and you feel a sense of community without being in one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the fun experience, ruby on rails also provided various tools and features that came out of the box. This would cut down the development time extremely short and increase developer productivity. However, as the time went on and the framework stabilized, the craze died down and trend moved elsewhere. People and companies stopped using ruby on rails and moved on to JavaScript or other languages and frameworks. That is the purpose of trends, to move to the next one… &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; all of them moved because of trends … I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes sense that ruby on rails was &lt;em&gt;the king&lt;/em&gt; for a while. JavaScript (among other frameworks and languages) was not where it is in 2020 and Nodejs was not even a thing. Let alone having LTS releases of Nodejs that enterprise could use and rely on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I am talking from MY experience and my day-to-day programming. Or should I say ranting about my experience with ruby on rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest negative I found, while working on rails, is that the systems usually turn into spaghetti code. I’ve seen this happen time after time first hand. This type of environment is definitely not fun to untangle or add features to. It becomes &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; minus the fun. Second, rails is fairly resource intensive and for a good reason – it comes with a lot of utility out of the box. Third, making rails fast is possible but requires some rolling up of the sleeves and jumping into the framework specific adjustments. Fourth, and this one is kind of my pet peeve … having ruby on rails work differently from its intension, from convention over configuration, is a headache. Moreover, you should be familiar with enough of the framework as to not damage other parts that you may be modifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, ruby on rails is still my goto for starting new projects but it is not as fun as it used to be. I want to be working on problems not debating if I should ditch ruby on rails for something else. I do wonder if it is laziness at this point or familiarity that is preventing me from jumping ruby ship. There is far less people using it and far less excitement talking to other programmers using the framework. It is harder to find like minded people. It seems that DHH from Basecamp is the only one that is still spearheading how awesome and relevant ruby on rails is. It is his investment after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure you can have any of these problems in any other language or framework. And sure, my problems listed above can be fixed by refactoring, reading the documents, staying with the convention, and just doing the work. When you start fixing the problems, it becomes additional work that someone has to do that is hard to sell to a manager. All of this to say, is that it removes the fun for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking this for some time now and wanted to put it in words and archive it. Perhaps if I was still being paid to work with ruby or on ruby on rails, I would have a different opinion. I’ll continue to take on ruby on rails projects but I am on the lookout for new frameworks and languages … at least for personal projects and quick prototypes. I want to explore python and I would like to give Go a go ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of python, django seems be a good contender and to fit the need of ruby on rails. My current plan is to slowly learn python and django if there is time. Anndddd… nodejs and javascript are good too and are widely used. I’ll see how my new projets go =)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There… out of my head. Heh.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Keeping up with keeping up</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/keeping-up-in-software"/>
   <updated>2020-03-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/keeping-up-in-software</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you are not producing projects, writing, or contributing socially and you are a software person, are you growing? I have been experiencing a bit of FOMO. You see, last year I kind of went on a social diet of sorts and reduced my presence on social platforms. One of the negative outcomes of this, is my lack of output during this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you see, I have had output at work but that does not satisfy me. I don’t have a thing that I can show or talk about that is interesting on average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that in this software craftperson field, you need to be methodical about your work plus document it. Plus… plus… you need to showcase it somehow. A portfolio is kind of a must in our software field. At least for now, since I don’t know what the future holds. I mean, architects and artists have a portfolio that they carry and showcase. I suppose, why not software craftpersons as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The projects don’t have to be finished or in a perfect state, any state will do well as a showcase of your work. The older I grow, the more happy I am that I keep some of my chaotic work on this domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to work a bit more to describe the various projects and work that I did throughout the years. I hope that by writing more frequently in this blog I will be more attune with my thought process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I prefer to think of my work as a constant flow of never ending ideas. A stream of consciousness that seems to be the right thing to do at the right time. This space is where I record it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will try &lt;em&gt;yet again&lt;/em&gt; to be less critical and be more permissive at recording and producing output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They&lt;/em&gt; say that you should not worry and just make for the sake of making. While, that is true … it helps to document that work in THIS field.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Updates</title>

   <updated>2020-03-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/updates</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-updates-since-last-post-on-december-2018&quot;&gt;Some updates since last post on December 2018&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;not using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com&quot;&gt;fastmail&lt;/a&gt; – I currently paused on using fastmail for a more affordable &lt;a href=&quot;https://privateemail.com&quot;&gt;namecheap email&lt;/a&gt; alternative. It works just fine for now.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Took a pause – last year was intense and required me to take a pause. I had a lot of personal issues last year that took time away from all of my previously enjoyed side projects. Thus, I had to put most of them on pause. Taking a pause really threw a wrench in my motivation and my previous velocity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Elderoost - also happens that someone purchased elderoost.com as I paused on the project. Very weird; oh well. All of the data and the actual project is offline. The project currently is currently on pause as I learn django. Goal is to re-write the project using Python.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Daily Vibes - I did not repay my Apple’s developer fee so my project is not available from the Apple store any longer. I can show you the project in person if you like. Project is on pause for now. I still have ideas on returning to the project however. I am considering a re-write for version 2 – I will probably pay for the developer fees only as I get closer to production. Been thinking of rewriting in React Native or something cross-platform.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;daily 15 minutes of reading&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;daily 30 minutes of software&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;being deliberate about daily practice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;building better habbits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;attacking-weaknesses&quot;&gt;Attacking weaknesses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the best way to attack my weaknesses is to, first, identify them. Sometimes this takes a lot of effort because you need to be systematic about your days. Best way to record and identify this is to use a diary or a journal. I am currently attacking my two weaknesses that I want to be more productive in :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;regular software / programming and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;regular reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am reading for at least 15 minutes per day. I am doing a 30 minutes a day programming activity. At this moment, I am learning python language and django framework. I hope to move on to 30 minutes a day of regular programming. I will then move on to the competitive programming to get ready for interviews. However, I am hoping to acquire new skills such that I would be ready for future interviews on a shorter schedule. Current timeline, goal is to be ready for summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some recent excerpts from the Flow Book :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Without the goal and the challenges usually provided by a job, only a rare self-discipline can keep the mind focused intensely enough to insure a meaningful life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When spending time at home with the fam­ily or alone, people often lack a clear purpose, do not know how well they are doing, are distracted, feel that their skills are underutilized, and as a result feel bored or-more rarely anxious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In our ESM studies we find that even physical health is better when a person focuses on a goal. On weekends, when alone, and with nothing to do, people report more symptoms of illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In other words, each of the flow-producing activities requires an initial investment of attention before it begins to be enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When productive activities become too routine and meaningless, leisure will pick up the slack. It will take up progressively more time, and rely on in­creasingly more elaborate artificial stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Setup custom fastmail email account for your business domain</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/fastmail-business-email"/>
   <updated>2018-12-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/fastmail-business-email</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-std.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/0hcE7y&quot; alt=&quot;Title of the article&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night, I activated the first business-y email account for our &lt;a href=&quot;https://cspray.ca&quot;&gt;cspray.ca&lt;/a&gt; project using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com&quot;&gt;Fastmail&lt;/a&gt; email service. What I mean by that is — I wanted to send and receive email using something like: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;info@cspray.ca&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is super exciting for me because it definitely gives &lt;a href=&quot;https://cspray.ca&quot;&gt;cspray.ca&lt;/a&gt; a new level of professionalism. Plus it looks super cool and official. Now that I’ve done it, I want to document the tl;dr of the process for myself and share with you along the way. I wish I would have done this sooner because it is really &lt;strong&gt;EASY&lt;/strong&gt; to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’ve had email catchers before but I’ve never had the opportunity to send emails from my own domain. Plus, I’ve been looking at trying out new tools for my email anyway. I’ve been with google’s email service since its inception. All of the things aligned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is the tl;dr of the requirements if you want to follow along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;NOTE: I am using affiliate links for &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.do.co/c/580b8ad4e397&quot;&gt;digitalocean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linode.com/?r=eb8fbe18fcae4bb7ac3cf4b65d578ea40d1da5f2&quot;&gt;linode&lt;/a&gt;. If you were going to open up a new VPS anyway… why not send a few referral bucks myway? Every penny helps my dear friend &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;namecheap for my domain ( but I do all of the DNS stuff via &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.do.co/c/580b8ad4e397&quot;&gt;digitalocean&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.do.co/c/580b8ad4e397&quot;&gt;digitalocean&lt;/a&gt; * for my VPS that also hosts my &lt;a href=&quot;https://cspray.ca&quot;&gt;cspray.ca&lt;/a&gt; domain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.do.co/c/580b8ad4e397&quot;&gt;digitalocean&lt;/a&gt; * control panel for domains setup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com&quot;&gt;fastmail&lt;/a&gt; for the email service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;NOTE: I am planning to move away from &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.do.co/c/580b8ad4e397&quot;&gt;digitalocean&lt;/a&gt;. Testing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linode.com/?r=eb8fbe18fcae4bb7ac3cf4b65d578ea40d1da5f2&quot;&gt;linode&lt;/a&gt; at the moment. Looks promising. Open to suggestions =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the present, I manage my domain from my VPS panel located on &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.do.co/c/580b8ad4e397&quot;&gt;digitalocean&lt;/a&gt;. All of my information is contained in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the best part? You have a 30 day trial to see if it works for you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: I found this &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesonzimmer.com/namecheap-fastmail-mx-custom-domain/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; to be super useful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tldr--the-final-version-will-be-&quot;&gt;tl;dr — the final version will be :&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018-12-10/cspray-digitalocean-fastmail-tldr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image of the finished result as seen from the digitalocean dashboard&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;add-3-cname-records&quot;&gt;Add 3 CNAME Records&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Hostname&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;TTL (seconds)&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;CNAME&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;fm3._domainkey.&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cspray.ca&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;is an alias of&lt;/em&gt; fm3.&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cspray.ca&lt;/code&gt;.dkim.fmhosted.com&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3600&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;CNAME&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;fm2._domainkey.&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cspray.ca&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;is an alias of&lt;/em&gt; fm2.&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cspray.ca&lt;/code&gt;.dkim.fmhosted.com&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3600&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;CNAME&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;fm1._domainkey.&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cspray.ca&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;is an alias of&lt;/em&gt; fm1.&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cspray.ca&lt;/code&gt;.dkim.fmhosted.com&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3600&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;add-2-mx-records&quot;&gt;Add 2 MX Records&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Hostname&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Priority&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;TTL (seconds)&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;MX&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cspray.ca&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;mail handled by&lt;/em&gt; in2-smtp.messagingengine.com.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3600&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;MX&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cspray.ca&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;mail handled by&lt;/em&gt; in2-smtp.messagingengine.com.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3600&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;add-1-txt-record&quot;&gt;Add 1 TXT Record&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Hostname&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;TTL (seconds)&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;TXT&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cspray.ca&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;returns&lt;/em&gt; v=spf1 include:spf.messagingengine.com ?all&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3600&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;after-3-cname-2-mx-and-1-txt-entries-&quot;&gt;After 3 CNAME, 2 MX, and 1 TXT entries …&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;go check on your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com&quot;&gt;fastmail&lt;/a&gt; account setting dashboard under domains. Everything should just work. If not, there is a button to try again or refresh or something along those lines to start the process again in case there was an error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;note-mac-native-mailapp-installation&quot;&gt;Note: Mac native Mail.app installation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;follow the automatic installation link that you get during the process of creating a brand new application password&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it works as of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;2018-12-10 19:13:12&lt;/code&gt; on Mojave &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;10.14.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;note-ios-12-installation&quot;&gt;Note: iOS 12 installation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com&quot;&gt;fastmail&lt;/a&gt;’s tutorial for adding an account so that I can receive and send my email using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/help/clients/iphone.html?u=1f694097&quot;&gt;native&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s Mail.app. More specifically, I got stuck on the following screen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018-12-10/iso12_iphone_sevenplus_fastmail_error.png&quot; alt=&quot;image of the place where I got stuck in fastmail's automatic setup for ios 12&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work around is simple: just enter it manually. Check out this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/help/clients/iphone-manual.html?u=1f694097&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incoming Host Name: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;imap.fastmail.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Username: your full FastMail username, including the domain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Password: your iPhone app password (What’s an app password?)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Outgoing Host Name: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;smtp.fastmail.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Username: your full FastMail username, including the domain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Password: your iPhone app password (What’s an app password?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;references&quot;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you will need to create &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/help/clients/apppassword.html?u=1f694097&quot;&gt;app password&lt;/a&gt;s a bunch… so read about it…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;setup &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/help/account/2fa.html?u=1f694097&quot;&gt;2-fa&lt;/a&gt; security for your business account. ps: don’t use the cellphone/text option… use something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://freeotp.github.io/&quot;&gt;FreeOTP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you next time&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Binary trees</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/binary-trees"/>
   <updated>2018-10-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/binary-trees</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;!-- &lt;script src=&quot;https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;assume&quot;&gt;Assume:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;let T = nonempty binary tree&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;let n = number of nodes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;let n_e = number of external nodes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;let n_i = number of internal nodes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;let h = height of T&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;then-t-has-following-properties&quot;&gt;Then, T has following properties:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;height of the nonempty binary tree + 1 &lt;strong&gt;is less than or equal to&lt;/strong&gt; the number of nodes in the binary tree &lt;strong&gt;is less than or equal to&lt;/strong&gt; 2^(height of the nonempty binary tree + 1) — 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 &lt;strong&gt;is less than or equal to&lt;/strong&gt; number of external nodes in the nonempty binary tree &lt;strong&gt;is less than or equal to&lt;/strong&gt; 2^(height of the nonempty binary tree)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;height of the nonempty binary tree &lt;strong&gt;is less than or equal to&lt;/strong&gt; number of internal nodes of the nonempty binary tree &lt;strong&gt;is less than or equal to&lt;/strong&gt; 2^(height of nonempty binary tree) — 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;log of (number of nodes in nonempty binary tree) — 1 &lt;strong&gt;is less than or equal to&lt;/strong&gt; height of the nonempty binary tree &lt;strong&gt;is less than or equal to&lt;/strong&gt; number of nodes in nonempty binary tree — 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… sorry this was one was also not finished :’-(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for context plan was to illustrate this using 3djs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you next time&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Position vs index</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/position-vs-index"/>
   <updated>2018-10-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/position-vs-index</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered why you sometimes see &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; and sometimes &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; keywords in code fragments?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… numeric indices are not a good choice for describing positions within a linked list because, knowing only an element’s index, the only way to reach it is to traverse the list incrementally from its beginning or end, counting elements along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… position, which formalizes the intuitive notion of the “location” of an element relative to others in the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To provide a general abstraction for the location of an element within a structure, we define a simple position abstract data type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be mindful that this is described within the context of Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all stemmed from my reading of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Positional List Abstract Data Type&lt;/code&gt;. At the same time, this text was fun to read because it got linked to graphs and their traversals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The advantage of receiving a position as a return value is that we can subsequently use that position to traverse the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and right away they give you a traversal example (the connection to graphs is obvious if you’ve worked with them before)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;after&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This position list has a bunch of update methods that work like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Return value&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Contents&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;addLast(5)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;p&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;(5p)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;addAfter(p, 7)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;q&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;(5p, 7q)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;addFirst(4)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;r&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;(4r, 5p, 7q)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;addBefore(r, 1)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;s&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;(1s, 4r, 5p, 7q)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;set(p, 0)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;(1s, 4r, 0p, 7q)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;remove(p)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;(1s, 4r, 7q)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

   <title>Stacks October 25 2018</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/stacks-october-25-2018"/>
   <updated>2018-10-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/stacks-october-25-2018</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On “Implementing a Stack with a Singly Linked List”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In designing such an implementation, we need to decide if the top of the stack is at the front or back of the list. There is clearly a best choice here, however, since we can insert and delete elements in constant time only at the front. With the top of the stack stored at the front of the list, all methods execute in constant time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Adapter Pattern&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One general way to apply the adapter pattern is to define a new class in such a way that it contains an instance of the existing class as a hidden field, and then to implement each method of the new class using methods of this hidden instance variable. &lt;strong&gt;By applying the adapter pattern&lt;/strong&gt; in this way, we have created a new class that performs some of the same functions as an existing class, but repackaged in a more convenient way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a stack can be used as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a general tool to reverse a data sequence (due to how last in first out works and all)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;mathing delimiters in an expressions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;matching tags in a markup language&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;navigation (browsers, ui, back/forward)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;important task when processing arithmetic expressions is to make sure their delimiting symbols match up correctly. We can use a stack to perform this task with a single left-to-right scan of the original string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If the length of the original expression is n, the algorithm will make at most n calls to push and n calls to pop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eh, why not queues too then&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Another fundamental data structure is the queue. It is a close “cousin” of the stack, but a queue is a collection of objects that are inserted and removed according to the first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle. That is, elements can be inserted at any time, but only the element that has been in the queue the longest can be next removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are many other applications of queues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Stores, theaters, reservation centers, and other similar services typically process customer requests according to the FIFO principle. A queue would therefore be a logical choice for a data structure to handle calls to a customer service center, or a wait-list at a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a queue can be used&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by like your reservation systems
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;like on limited resources (resource allocation… a… reservation system)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;web servers serving requests&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;a network printer with a printer queue&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;queue abstract data type defines a collection that keeps objects &lt;strong&gt;in a sequence&lt;/strong&gt;, where element &lt;strong&gt;access&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;deletion&lt;/strong&gt; are &lt;strong&gt;restricted&lt;/strong&gt; to the first element in the queue, and &lt;strong&gt;element insertion is restricted to the back&lt;/strong&gt; of the sequence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never noticed the &lt;em&gt;sequence&lt;/em&gt; word in the definition of a queue before — even if intuitively used it. See how important definitions and terminology is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The queue ADT also includes the following accessor methods (with first being analogous to the stack’s top method)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See how natural the transition from a stack to a queue is when you connect things?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://jordankasper.com/object-oriented-javascript-part-the-first/&quot;&gt;Object Oriented JavaScript (Part the First)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;literalDog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// declaration AND instantiation&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Vincent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// object property&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;speak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// object method&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; says woof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;literalDog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;speak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// &quot;Vincent says woof&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Inside of the speak method the this variable will refer to the current context of the function execution. This is an &lt;strong&gt;important distinction with classically object oriented languages&lt;/strong&gt;: the &lt;strong&gt;value of this can (and often does) change&lt;/strong&gt;! In most cases, this inside of a method like the one above will refer to the current object or instance. Without some other influence, if a method is called with “dot” syntax as in the last line above, then you can generally expect this inside the function to be whatever is on the left side of the dot. Inside of literalDog.speak() the this variable will refer to the object left of the dot: literalDog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;speak&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; says woof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Vincent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;First of all, the use of the capitol “D” in Dog is only done by convention, this is &lt;strong&gt;not a requirement&lt;/strong&gt; of the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which obviously leads to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… &lt;strong&gt;any function&lt;/strong&gt; in JavaScript can be used as a “constructor” …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, naturally&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If Dog is just a regular function, why don’t we just call it normally? Why do we need to use the new keyword?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah man, why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To answer that, we have to understand that every function in JavaScript has a concept of a &lt;strong&gt;prototype&lt;/strong&gt;; which is, generally speaking, a representation of what the newly created instance should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a function is an object. An object that uses this prototype concept to define itself. As a result, when we are calling the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; reserved keyword, what happens is three of the following things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Create an empty object;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;set the new object’s prototype to point to the prototype;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;and call the constructor method on the new object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The reason for illustrating what the new keyword is doing is to highlight that it is not the same as &lt;strong&gt;classically inherited languages&lt;/strong&gt;. In JavaScript, &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;syntactic sugar&lt;/strong&gt; and nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure why but I really liked this explanation. JavaScript has a lot of interesting concepts that you don’t really need to master in order for everything to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went ahead with his example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;speak&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; says woof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then I used it the regular way that I am used to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;doggo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Thunder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;doggo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;speak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Thunder says woof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but I also implemented it the new way. I am not used to creating objects this way, but it adds to my javascript knowledge for sure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;otherDoggo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// step 1 and step 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;otherDoggo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Thunder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// step 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;otherDoggo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;speak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Thunder says woof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest with you, I would prefer to use it this way just because it allows me to context switch between other concepts and javascript way faster. Seeing the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; keyword almost automatically makes me think in a wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To which the author of the article made a note&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are some people in the JavaScript community who feel that syntactic sugar like the new keyword does more harm than good and choose not to use it at all. However, with ECMAScript 6 (ES6) pushing for more syntactic sugar surrounding OOP, it is unlikely that it will lose favor on a wider scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and that is so. People prefer to write shorter syntax but I believe it makes learning such a weird language a bit more challenging. Which is fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A side issue — which is prevelant everywhere in software — nobody goes back and fixes all of the old tutorials. As a result JavaScript evolves but the answers you get when you search on google or stackoverflow can be from any date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you are following some JavaScript tutorial and trying to understand some concepts. None of the tutorials ever state that JavaScript implementation is browser specific and environment specific. Yes … the various vendors are finally becoming similar but there are small differences. Afterall, the vendors are simply implementing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript&quot;&gt;ECMAScript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You still see these differences in 2018. For example, if I go back to the same article as I linked above, the text expects you to see something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Bubbles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;speak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; says woof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;__proto__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but what you see in most up-to-date firefox is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018-10-20/firefox-Screen-Shot-2018-10-20-at-11.49.27.png&quot; alt=&quot;web developer tools output from firefox october 2018&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;whereas in chrome you see&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018-10-20/chrome-Screen-Shot-2018-10-20-at-12.09.05.png&quot; alt=&quot;web developer tools output from chrome october 2018&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so my strategy my dear friend would be to understand the fundamentals. This way, you can adjust the syntax based on your environment. Unfortunately this will be so until all vendors catch up (if ever). Looking back on the past few years — I trully believed we would have it standardized by now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing, if you read the previous essay, that I wanted to improve my understanding in was the indirect invocation below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Runner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;instanceof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Rabbit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Rabbit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;countLegs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;instanceof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Rabbit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Indirect invocation. Call parent constructor.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Runner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;countLegs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;countLegs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;myRabbit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Rabbit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;White Rabbit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;myRabbit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// { name: 'White Rabbit', countLegs: 4 }&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;specifically&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Runner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I seem to have discovered that answer from the same article&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The parent method will not be automatically called for you!  The trick is that we can’t simply call Animal() directly because the context inside that function will not be correct. Calling a function &lt;strong&gt;like that&lt;/strong&gt; would typically set this inside the function to point to the window object, our default context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and if you recall JavaScript has several ways to invoke functions. It is important to understand because &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; is set during invocation. Thus, that is exactly how this type of function invocation in JavaScript works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… Instead, we have to &lt;strong&gt;manually&lt;/strong&gt; call the Animal constructor function while changing its context to point to our new Dog instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;alive&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;isAlive&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;alive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;die&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;alive&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Bubbles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// The remainder of Dog.prototype members...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Vincent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The key to understanding this relationship is understanding that the &lt;strong&gt;prototype object&lt;/strong&gt; is a &lt;strong&gt;fall back mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[i]f the current instance object (v) does not have an age property directly on it JavaScript will “fall back” to the first prototype (Dog.prototype) and look for age there. If that object doesn’t have an age property, JavaScript will “fall back” to the next prototype, in this case Animal.prototype (defined by the __proto__ member of Dog.prototype). There it is! JavaScript found a member called age on the Animal.prototype and will use that value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This structure is referred to as the prototype chain and falling back to successive prototypes &lt;strong&gt;is the mechanism by which JavaScript creates inheritance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;polymorphism&quot;&gt;Polymorphism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But this is not exactly polymorphism since the two functions do not share a name or form (different method signatures). To show how JavaScript supports this concept we need another example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Notice how the Animal object has an age property. This is great, but perhaps we want the age to always be represented in “human years” (which we’ll assume is the default).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getAge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and consequently&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getAge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dogYears&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getAge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dogYears&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus both &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; have &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getAge()&lt;/code&gt; but the functionality is a bit different. I’ll let the author explain as they do a good job&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are a couple things to note in the example above. First, we must use the method as it is defined on the Animal.prototype in order to call the parent method. If we try to simply call this.getAge() JavaScript will think we want the Dog.prototype.getAge method and we’ll enter a recursive, infinite loop! Second, we have to use the apply method of the getAge function object in order to switch the context again. Remember, if we were to simply call the method as is (Animal.prototype.getAge()) then the context will be the object on the left side of the dot: Animal.prototype. It will not be our Dog instance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once we have retrieved the stored age value, we can simply return that value multiplied by 7. In this manner &lt;strong&gt;we are able to achieve polymorphism&lt;/strong&gt; by having a method with the same name and same function signature, but with different implementations depending on the type of object (Animal versus Dog versus Cat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we are able to write code that looks something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Call parent method of the same name&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; (the dog)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toLowerCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;speak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; says woof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is nice to know the prototypical background of the language. It is the foundation of the language and how it fundamentally  works. This way it does not matter which abstractions are built on top — you simply adjust =)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of issues learning JavaScript as I was coming from a typical accredited computer science background. JavaScript is this frankenstein of a language that dominates the present software terrain. However, the varied implementation by vendors is less than ideal for its stability to teach new staff and overall well being of the language. I wish there was a better management of outdated information. JavaScript is constantly changing so I am not sure if this is possible in this never ending race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reminds me of the issues that people had surrounding learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails: the various syntactic magic that goes behind the scenes. I don’t think all of this magic is an issue in JavaScript environment for one big reason — JavaScript is free and all you need is a browser. Nobody to pay any fees; nothing to install; do not need to pay for an IDE. Plus, you get to take all of the invested development hours and use it for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can’t say the same for Ruby on Rails or any other language or framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you next time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;use strict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// create a bound function with context&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// invoke the bound function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// =&amp;gt; 6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// =&amp;gt; 20&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Contrary to .apply() and .call() methods (see 5.), which invokes the function right away, the .bind() method only returns a new function that it supposed to be invoked later with a pre-configured this.
.bind() makes a permanent context link and will always keep it. A bound function cannot change its linked context when using .call() or .apply() with a different context, or even a rebound doesn’t have any effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;numbers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getNumbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Create a bound function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;boundGetNumbers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;numbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getNumbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;numbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;boundGetNumbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// =&amp;gt; [3, 5, 10]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Extract method from object&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;simpleGetNumbers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;numbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getNumbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;simpleGetNumbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// =&amp;gt; undefined or throws an error in strict mode&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Because the function invocation has the biggest impart on this, from now on do not ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Where is this taken from?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;but do ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;How is the function invoked?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For an arrow function ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;What is this where the arrow function is defined?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is kind of funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you next time!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://crockford.com/javascript/private.html&quot;&gt;Private Members in JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Private members are made by the constructor. Ordinary vars and parameters of the constructor become the private members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They are attached to the object, but they are not accessible to the outside, nor are they accessible to the object’s own public methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By convention&lt;/strong&gt;, we make a private that variable. This is used to make the object available to the private methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;someFunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;someParam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Private methods cannot be called by public methods. To make private methods useful, we need to introduce a privileged method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A privileged method is able to access the private variables and methods, and is itself accessible to the public methods and the outside. &lt;strong&gt;It is possible to delete or replace a privileged method&lt;/strong&gt;, but it is not possible to alter it, or to force it to give up its secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This pattern of public, private, and privileged members is possible because JavaScript has closures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Private and privileged members can &lt;strong&gt;only be made&lt;/strong&gt; when an object is constructed. Public members can be added at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;patterns-public&quot;&gt;Patterns: Public&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;member&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;publicMember&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newMember&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;patterns-private&quot;&gt;Patterns: Private&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;someMember&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;someValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;someFunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;someParam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“If big tech companies are going to turn their back on the DoD, this country is going to be in trouble,” said Bezos on stage at the Wired25 conference in San Francisco on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can view this comment through my Canadian glasses =) Having worked in academia, private, and, now, government environments at various levels — I can definitely appreciate the intricacies that go behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; different countries, we follow similar implementations of organizational structures. We most likely use similar enterprise hardware and software. I also assume that applications of these things are similar in US and Canada. I further assume that such organizations have similar goals (perhaps different strategies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I see something like the following&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It has already worked with the DoD and multiple law enforcement agencies have used its facial recognition system – Rekognition. Amazon employees and civil liberties organizations &lt;strong&gt;claimed that the software could be used [to] violate human rights&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it makes me stop and think about the various things that could be going on during these discussions. Things that are not even about the technology &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations, like a government or some equivalent, usually &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_proposal&quot;&gt;need&lt;/a&gt; something. These needs are then distributed down their vines using the appropriate channels. So if a need &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; distributed then that means a bunch of things happened and it was approved. Where am I going with this? While I am using very big generalities, I am just trying to say that maybe other angles could be explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the following article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1&quot;&gt;AOMedia Video 1&lt;/a&gt; — very confusing at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AV1 is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… meant to succeed its predecessor VP9 and compete with HEVC/H.265 from the Moving Picture Experts Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The confusing part was that Apple is involved in the HEVC/H.265 format AND in this format (because they are part of Alliance for Open Media). But as I read on I realized why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HEVC/H.265 is royalty &lt;em&gt;bearing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AV1 is royalty &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that makes sence =)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also noticing that I am spending way too much on these and that was never the intention. I keep editing or deleting. My focus is on interview prep. Anywho, see you next time =)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fixing your weakness</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/fixing-your-weaknesses"/>
   <updated>2018-10-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/fixing-your-weaknesses</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After writing this &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/relationships-between-sets-series-progressions-and-sequences&quot;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago, I could not stop thinking of figuring out where exactly my error is. Like I mentioned before, I understand the subject matter but not as deep as I would like to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I began by looking backwards: I wanted to figure out during which course I was introduced to them first. I knew that it was around first or second year; and I knew that it was in Calculus. I did not remember if it was Calculus I or Calculus II. I could not remember but why struggle when you can look this up? Since my degree is from an accredited institution that provides accredited degrees — I can simply request this information or look it up. All of the courses and their description is fully published at uOttawa so this took me a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out it was first introduced to me during Calculus II. While I didn’t have my notes, I did recall which textbook I used to study and I recall exactly where we studied this. I did have the textbook so I just went ahead and looked it up. And then everything clicked in for me — I figured out how I got confused around series and sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was precisely in Chapter 8 of this (not) so wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Single-Variable-Calculus-published-Hardcover/dp/B00E27YJ0E&quot;&gt;textbook&lt;/a&gt; by James Stewart. Why do I say not so wonderful? Because, looking on the order of topics presented in retrospect, sequences, series, and limits of these things were introduced at the same time. What I did not realize when I was younger — professors usually follow a textbook for their instructions. So, if the textbook does not match your studying techniques then the way the knowledge is delivered via professor will not aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sequence is introduced as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A sequence can be thought of as a list of numbers written in a definite order …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok good I can follow that. One thing that should have been bolded, in my opinion, was the &lt;em&gt;definite order&lt;/em&gt; part of the definition but it was not. Right after the definition, we were shown three ways of describing a sequence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… one by using the preceding notation, another by using the defining formula, and a third by writing out the terms of the sequence …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, even though I’ve never seen this before presented like this I can follow along. Then they moved to describing how you could find such a description on your own via an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… [n]otice that the numerators of these fractions start with 3 and increase by 1 whenever we go to the next term. The second term has numerator 4, the third term has numerator 5; in general, the nth term will have numerator n + 2. The denominators are the powers of 5,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… so an has denominator 5n. The signs of the terms are alternately positive and negative, so we need to multiply by a power of 1. In Example 1(b) the factor …  meant we started with a negative term. Here we want to start with a positive term and so we use …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at it now — there is a lot going on above and definitely went above my head when I was introduced OR I did not understand it. But that was not the culprit — you can get by just fine with not understanding this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the same page we get some new examples of sequences that is introduced as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… sequences that don’t have simple defining equations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boom. Problem 1 — sequences don’t have simple defining equations. That is such a subtle and non-bolded way of describing an important property of sequences. But don’t worry, as you keep reading this example, one sub-example at a time, you come to the famous Fibonacci sequence that everyone loves to introduce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how do they introduce this example? Using limits ofcourse. This is calculus afterall. This was Problem 2 for my understanding. These two problems are the reasons where everything went downhill. The text went on to the properties such as convergence and divergence and others. Nowhere, was there a connection of some sort to series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I mean&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018-10-16/fibonacci-sequence-introduction.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fibonacci sequence&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how was a series introduced?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What do we mean when we express a number as an infinite decimal? For instance, what does it mean to write…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… The convention behind our decimal notation is that any number can be written as an infinite sum. Here it means that…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… where the three dots … indicate that the sum continues forever, and the more terms we add, the closer we get to the actual value of pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it make sense to you if you were seeing this for the first time? It did not for me. If you keeping reading there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a mention of a connection between a sequence and a serience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… Thus the sum of a series is the limit of the sequence of partial sums. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so I cannot say that the author did not connect the ideas. But I can say that it was not clear for me then. When you combine the idea that the textbook was not helpful, the speed at which education moves, and a teacher that follows the book without helping you — you move on and keep going. Obviously I adapted and learned, otherwise I would not have graduated magna cum laude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole thing was pretty surreal for me and super exciting. Not only did I narrow down my confusion surrounding sequences and series but I also uncovered the exact point where I got confused. Anywho, I’m going to continue studying my weak areas so that I can improve my analysis of algorithms. I think that I am pretty good but I want to be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally I was going to write about something else but this experience was more exciting for today. Here are some links that I was going to talk about (I still want to talk about them in the future at some point)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18227768&quot;&gt;To become a software consultant, avoid letting clients pay you for code (2017) (daedtech.com)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and from the Hawkings article I highlighted&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist,” he said. “It matters that you don’t give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it my friend. Figure out things that you do not understand and address them. Don’t be afraid to do so at any time — perhaps, even years later ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you tomorrow&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mostly been doing a buncha practice and reviewing. You can probably skip reading this entry =) It is me sharing code I wrote and nothing crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Followed along and made these things&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* SinglyLinkedList */&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;com.example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/*
    SinglyLinkedList Supports:
        - int size()
            - returns size of linked list
        - boolean isEmpty()
            - return if it is empty or not
        - void addFirst(E element)
            - adds a new element and places it at the front of the list
        - void addLast(E element)
            - adds a new element and places it at the end of the list
        - E removeFirst()
            - removes the first element from the list
            - and returns it
        - E first()
            - returns the first element
            - (does not remove it from the list)
        - E last()
            - returns the last element
            - (does not remove it from the list)

        If you notice the removal operation is wonderful for the first element;
        Unfortunately the same cannot be said for removing at the end. As we require the previous node (for the tail node)
        to do our reference address switchery we would have to traverse the list from the head until the tail.
        This proves to the the limitation of this structure and why

   <title>Ceaser cipher and other things</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/ceaser-cipher"/>
   <updated>2018-10-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/ceaser-cipher</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, I was browing again in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.ca/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118771338/&quot;&gt;textbook&lt;/a&gt; and for some reason I wanted to implement a simple Ceaser cipher. In the process, I also re-found-out that Strings are immutable in java. I suppose it makes sense then when StringBuilder and the such are used. I also found the following two statements interesting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… that characters are represented in Unicode by integer code points …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… upper letters of the Latin alphabet are consecutive (for simplicity …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and you know what? No one has ever connected these two ideas together like that or pointed it out. I’ve used these exact ideas before and never considered how fortunate that everything just works (= Why — &lt;em&gt;duh&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; is obviously &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;65&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;66&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anywho, I wanted to implement this shifting algorithm and this is how far we got:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;java&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;CeaserCypher&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… and I wish I could take credit for this but alas. Followed along with the book and after much back and forth I ended up with pretty much exactly the same version as in the book. This is why, if you notice, there is a decoding key but I never even explored that. Was fun for a minute =)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Side note&lt;/em&gt;: I am not sure why, but I have a special place for character encoding. I think language construction (tables, lex, state machines, and so on…) and reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/&quot;&gt;The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)&lt;/a&gt; made me appreciate the idea that 65 is A. I like to revisit and re-read Joel from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… oh and probably the fact that I deal with such things day-to-day in my job also keeps the interest. You know… Canada… English and French ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and I finally configured and properly installed jenv, java11, and maven (&amp;amp; got it working with the other java installations). Should be much smoother now and I want to give heroku and java a try if I have a second this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;links&quot;&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A lot of these stemmed from this : &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Warning: Cask 'java' is already installed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that is it for now &amp;amp; I still have the pages for series and sequences open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Insertion Sort</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/insertion-sort"/>
   <updated>2018-10-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/insertion-sort</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Question: Suppose you have an algorithm that you are running that has multiple steps. When you are approximating, when do you add the runtimes and when do you multiply them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;do this, then when you are done with this, do that&lt;/code&gt;, then you add runtimes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;do this for each time you do that&lt;/code&gt;, then you multiply runtimes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-insertion-sort-algorithm&quot;&gt;The Insertion-Sort Algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this algorithm is simple: take an array of elements and sort it in an increasing order. It does so by inserting one element at a time and by comparing elements during insertion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Algorithm InsertionSort(A):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Input: An array A of n comparable elements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Output: The array A with elements rearranged in &lt;strong&gt;nondecreasing order&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We basically walk one element at a time, from 0 to n:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;for k from 1 to n do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Insert element A[k] at its proper location in the array at position A[0], A[1], A[2], …, A[k]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or as you would like to call it — increasing order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question: When will this algorithm behave the best?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: When the elements in the array are sorted in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question: When will this algorithm have the worst of times?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: When the elements in the array are placed in the reversed order (from high to low - a decreasing order). Our little guy will have to swap every element and move it to the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guided with the following from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.ca/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118771338/&quot;&gt;textbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;using an &lt;strong&gt;outer loop&lt;/strong&gt; to consider each element in turn,
and an &lt;strong&gt;inner loop&lt;/strong&gt; that moves a newly considered element to its proper location relative to the (sorted) subarray of elements that are to its left&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went on to do my own implementation — because why not and I could use some review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;insertionSort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/*

            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;insertPosition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Relationships between sets, series, progressions, and sequences</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/relationships-between-sets-series-progressions-and-sequences"/>
   <updated>2018-10-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/relationships-between-sets-series-progressions-and-sequences</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I ended up exploring a topic that I didn’t expect: what is the difference between a sequence and a series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I memorized these contepts in my calculus days, I always felt something was missing in my core understanding. I think I figured out what was missing. It seems that I was confused, once again, around the ambiguity of the English language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon the following in one of my favourite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.ca/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118771338/&quot;&gt;textbook&lt;/a&gt;s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A numeric progression is a sequence of numbers, where each number depends on one or more of the previous numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;followed by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;arithmetic progression determines the next number &lt;strong&gt;by adding&lt;/strong&gt; a fixed constant to the previous value&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;geometric progression determines the next number &lt;strong&gt;by multiplying&lt;/strong&gt; the previous value by a fixed constant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which made me go &lt;em&gt;Aha&lt;/em&gt;. All I had to do was check if the thing was made by adding or by multiplying? Seems easy enough to get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure I had the same thoughts back in school. So, I decided to play around and see what I find confusing so I could fix my gaps in knowledge. I thought: hmm, they are using both terms, a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;progression&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sequence&lt;/code&gt;, in one sentence. Confused — because if you don’t really pay attention then you could interpret these two terms as having a similar meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I should have considered was the specific word choice in math. Similar confusions were found in other areas. For example, different terminology in the graph space. One positive thing that I did notice is that specialty books are beginning to mention discrepancies surrounding word choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting back to progression and sequence confusion. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that I had confusion back in the day. Confusion around terminology and not the concepts. If you read one of the previous entries, then you recall me saying that pattern matching works to a certain degree. So, I used pattern matching during my former student days. It got me far enough but I was never satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike my former student self, I have the leisure and time to explore this further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the following excerpt on quora from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/How-does-sequence-and-progression-differ&quot;&gt;how does sequence and progression differ?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… all progressions are sequences, all sequences are not progression …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so that brought my understanding a bit closer. So a sequence is a collection of things. Hmm, but that sounds very close to what a set is. So, what is the difference between a sequence and a set? Is there one? Decided to consult wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence&quot;&gt;wikipedia definition&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a sequence is &lt;strong&gt;like a set&lt;/strong&gt; because they are a collection that contains things: members or elements. Like a set, this collection can be finite or infinite. Ok… so still not too clear so far. However, as we read further — what we find, is that in a sequence, &lt;em&gt;unlike in a set&lt;/em&gt;, repeated occurences of members are allowed. &lt;em&gt;Additionally&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;unlike in a set&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;order&lt;/strong&gt; of individual members in the collection &lt;strong&gt;matters&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a sequence does not have to be only denoted by [an explicit] formula. A sequence can also be denoted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogformathematics.blogspot.com/2011/08/sequences.html&quot;&gt;a logical statement&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A sequence may be denoted by an explicit formula, like Tn = 2 + n, or it may be denoted by a logical statement like Tn = nth prime number. It is &lt;strong&gt;not necessary that a set of numbers be arranged according to an explicit formula&lt;/strong&gt; in order for it to be called a ‘sequence’; it &lt;strong&gt;can also be arranged according to some logical statement&lt;/strong&gt; that does not have an explicit mathematical formula but is nonetheless mathematically logical in order for it to be called a sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the definition of a sequence and how it differs from a set is starting to make sense. How does a progression relate to all of this? Well, a &lt;em&gt;numeric&lt;/em&gt; progression is a &lt;strong&gt;sequence&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;em&gt;numbers&lt;/em&gt; where each element depends on &lt;em&gt;one or more&lt;/em&gt; of the &lt;strong&gt;previous&lt;/strong&gt; members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like in the quote above from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.ca/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118771338/&quot;&gt;textbook&lt;/a&gt;, it follows that there are at least two such relationships:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a relationship between two members such that the difference between these two members is a constant — this is called an &lt;em&gt;arithmetic progression&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;arithmetic sequence&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a relationship between two members such that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.math10.com/en/algebra/geometric-progression.html&quot;&gt;quotient of any two successive members of the sequence is a constant&lt;/a&gt; — this is called a &lt;em&gt;geometric progression&lt;/em&gt; or a &lt;em&gt;geometric sequence&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or said it another way (from the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.ca/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118771338/&quot;&gt;textbook&lt;/a&gt; as mentioned):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;geometric progression, in which each value is produced by multiplying the preceding value by a fixed constant, known as the &lt;strong&gt;base of the geometric progression&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have looked at a set, sequence, and a progression so far. How do these things relate to a &lt;em&gt;series&lt;/em&gt;? Very simple — a series is just the summation of all of the elements in the sequence. So, it then follows, what is the sum of the elements in a given sequence represented by? A series. Just like that. It finally makes sense how a series and a sequence are related. Nothing complicated. No new formulas. Just the proper definitions presented in a familiar way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the total sum of the sequence can be broken up into &lt;strong&gt;partial sum(s)&lt;/strong&gt; — a sum from element &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ai&lt;/code&gt; to element &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;an&lt;/code&gt;. What is interesting about this? Well the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence&quot;&gt;(p)artial sums, themselves, form a sequence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there you have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Trying out Aho–Corasick algorithm</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/aho-corasick-algorithm"/>
   <updated>2018-10-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/aho-corasick-algorithm</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_algorithm&quot;&gt;Aho–Corasick algorithm&lt;/a&gt;. I was instantly hooked on wanting to try it out. Since I am spending more time with Java, most of the day was spent playing with an implementation of this algorithm &lt;em&gt;and maven&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will tell you what, I was pleasantly surprised so far. I need to spend some more time on this but it looks like a promising solution. I wanted to use something like this on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://elderoost.com/&quot;&gt;elderoost&lt;/a&gt; project. So, here is what my MVP looks like so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this problem I wanted to use a large piece of text as input. For example, I was reading the news earlier and I found a good candidate. I used the following news article as my input:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ontario has promised to add 15,000 new long-term care beds across of the province in the next five years and increasing that to 30,000 in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Of the 6,000 being put in place immediately, 80 of them will be in Brant County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Your government is moving forward quickly to expand access to long-term care beds,” said Christine Elliott, the Deputy Premier and Minister of Health and Long-Term Care in a press release. “”More long-term care beds will help take the pressure off hospitals, end hallway medicine, allow doctors and nurses to work more efficiently and provide faster health care for Ontario patients and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The 80 beds will be shared between John Noble Home and Fox Ridge Care Community (Sienna Senior Living).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The province has also promised more than 1,100 beds and spaces in hospitals and community settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“This is good news for the people of Brantford-Brant,” said MPP Will Bouma in the release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which I grabbed from &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/brant-county-to-get-80-new-long-term-care-beds-1.4125702&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; so you know it is very fresh — &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Published Monday, October 8, 2018 5:31PM EDT&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then ran the MVP implementation against this input, and surprise surprise. I got the expected results of two hits on this article. Not only that, I also have the precise location in the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;672:687]&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;John Noble Home
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;692:716]&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;Fox Ridge Care Community
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you know what? This solution brought me closer to what I wanted to do and how I wanted to do it. My previous implementation was using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/&quot;&gt;Elasticsearch&lt;/a&gt; but I never liked that approach. This is why that solution is not public. It did not seem to meet the requirements that I had and it did not produce repetitive results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited spend some more time on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, almost forgot. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hankcs/AhoCorasickDoubleArrayTrie&quot;&gt;AhoCorasickDoubleArrayTrie&lt;/a&gt; implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;maven-frustrations&quot;&gt;Maven frustrations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent a minute today trying to sort out maven. Unfortunately, as I dug deeper, I found out that there was a play of two installations. I need to untangle this mess:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$JAVA_HOME&lt;/span&gt;
/Users/&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$user&lt;/span&gt;/.jenv/versions/openjdk64-11
  &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;jenv enable-plugin maven
maven plugin activated
  &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;maven
zsh: &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;command &lt;/span&gt;not found: maven
  &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;mvn
zsh: &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;command &lt;/span&gt;not found: mvn
  &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;jenv &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;exec &lt;/span&gt;maven
jenv: maven: &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;command &lt;/span&gt;not found
  &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;jenv &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;exec &lt;/span&gt;mvn
jenv: mvn: &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;command &lt;/span&gt;not found
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;links&quot;&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s random link of the day: &lt;a href=&quot;https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/&quot;&gt;Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures&lt;/a&gt; (DADS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also changed the content of structured data for this page.

If I recall correctly, I left it at &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;github.io&lt;/code&gt; because I had difficulties with sharing my content. I tried it today and it seems to work just fine. If it ever breaks again, I will just go back =)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>If you don't share your project, did you actually make it?</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/if-you-dont-share-your-project-did-you-actually-make-it"/>
   <updated>2018-10-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/if-you-dont-share-your-project-did-you-actually-make-it</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, I did a few quick fixes to the current layout of this website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I added &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;« Previous Essay&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Next Essay »&lt;/code&gt; links to each piece of writing at the end for easier navigation&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This required a slight modification to the templates. Found the following article &lt;a href=&quot;https://david.elbe.me/jekyll/2015/06/20/how-to-link-to-next-and-previous-post-with-jekyll.html&quot;&gt;Jekyll – how to link to next/previous post on your blog&lt;/a&gt; very useful in this venture. In fact, it is very simple. Like so:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.not-post-page-navigation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;space-around&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;not-post-page-navigation&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  {% if page.previous.url %}
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{page.previous.url}}&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;title=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{page.previous.title}}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ni&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;laquo;&lt;/span&gt;
    Previous Essay&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  {% endif %}
  {% if page.next.url %}
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{page.next.url}}&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;title=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{page.next.title}}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Next Essay &lt;span class=&quot;ni&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;raquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  {% endif %}
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I also had to look up how I could show you the code above because it had some inline liquid syntactic sugar. So the parser simply interpreted the code about as any regular code. You need to add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;raw&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;endraw&lt;/code&gt; tags before the code and proceed as before! See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/linguist/issues/3690&quot;&gt;Liquid syntax highlighting in Markdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also re-wrote the little script that I wrote in Swift a few days ago in Java. I’m basically jumping between languages because why not. Had some hiccups with looking up regular expressions syntax in Java. Here is the current working copy:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Please do like this: LazyTitleMaker &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;java&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;DateFormat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dateStyleFormat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SimpleDateFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;yyyy-MM-dd&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;currDate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;currDateText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dateStyleFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;currDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;toLowerCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inputWSReplaced&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;replaceAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;\\s+&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;-&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sanitizedString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inputWSReplaced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;replaceAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;[\\',?]&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;resultantURI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;currDateText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;-&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sanitizedString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;resultantURI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;.markdown&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Length: &quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;resultantURI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Need to fix the following code that you see above at some later time&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sanitizedString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inputWSReplaced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;replaceAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;[\\',?]&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to find all characters in the string that are not words and not spaces. I expected &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[^w]&lt;/code&gt; to match to all characters that are not words and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[^s]&lt;/code&gt; to match all characters that are not spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sanitizedString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inputWSReplaced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;replaceAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;[^\\w\\s]&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Similar to how I would do it in JavaScript&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Some Str,in'g?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toLowerCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;[^\w\s]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/ /g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I also changed the about page and the projects page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I added a new template for the about and projects pages&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Modified the way images are displayed in the liquid templates. Replaced &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;{:width=&quot;60%&quot;}&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;{:style=&quot;max-width:100%&quot;}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I removed the newsletter link at the footer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I adjusted my project involvement for Screenhole and Keyframes. Until further notice my involvement is on pause while &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinko.com&quot;&gt;Thinko&lt;/a&gt; focuses on other things. I enjoyed working with the team and hope to do so again the future. Jacob and Pasquale are wonderful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Played with modulo and reminder theories decoding a birthday message &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/37240042&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/3354251&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is fun to make things for no reason other than just because. So, what do I think about: &lt;em&gt;If you don’t share your project, did you actually make it?&lt;/em&gt; While I think it depends on the project and the goals, I think that decision is ultimately up to you. It is very easy to fall in the trap of sharing for the sake of sharing. For me — I first look at the project and then I look at the goals. Most likely than not the things that I share I hope others to find useful and educational.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Easy to get into a pattern of asking questions</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/easy-to-get-into-a-pattern-of-asking-questions"/>
   <updated>2018-10-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/easy-to-get-into-a-pattern-of-asking-questions</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I like to open up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/&quot;&gt;The 6th edition of Cracking the Coding Interview&lt;/a&gt; from time to time. Mainly to keep an up-to-date cheat sheet of things to narrow down during job search. All of the recruiters use some variation of things that is in this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I opened it up today and got some quotes from that book in no particular order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There’s another reason why data structure and algorithm knowledge comes up: because it’s hard to ask problem-solving questions that don’t involve them. It turns out that the vast majority of problem-solving questions involve some of these basics. &lt;strong&gt;When enough candidates know these basics, easy to get into a pattern of asking questions with them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quote talks about justifications of asking data structure and algorithm questions. It finishes off with some practical reasoning for this interview structure. You, as an applicant have to remember this. These scenarios are easy to create, modify, and repeat. Additionally, it could save immediate and future employee costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Not only might you be &lt;strong&gt;judged harshly&lt;/strong&gt; for not really understanding big 0, but you will also struggle to judge when your algorithm is getting faster or slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quote was in the context of Big O. I’ve personally experienced this in a group setting. It wasn’t during an interview per se but I’ve definitely been caught off guard by this. Some people say maybe you shouldn’t meet your heroes. Maybe that is true. I’ll let you be your own judge of that. In this case, the harsh judgement came from a well known and important person. If I was a fan of this person or their work, I would have found their approach not professional and would not have wanted to work with them. Approach was used on a group of 18-21 year olds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that this person used this approach as a strategy. A coping mechanism of some sort or a scare tactic. Or perhaps it allowed them to maintain order in their position. It made people less likely to approach them. Made the situation a bit more interesting since employees &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to approach them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Big O time is the language and metric we use to describe the efficiency of algorithms. Not understanding it thoroughly can really hurt you in developing an algorithm. Not only might you be &lt;strong&gt;judged harshly&lt;/strong&gt; for not really understanding big 0, but you will also struggle to &lt;strong&gt;judge&lt;/strong&gt; when your algorithm is getting faster or slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I find interesting about Big O in our industry is the lack of consensus among various parts of this industry. If you know about Big O, then there is very little ambiguity. Most people who are familiar give similar responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be some kind of this weird distinction of: us (industry) vs. them (academia). This has been so when I was in academia and it is continuing to exist as such. I think this issue comes from the word &lt;em&gt;approximation&lt;/em&gt;. You need some context to what you mean about an approximation. How good do you want it? Should it be a formal approximation? A rough estimate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you continue reading, a few lines down from the quote above we find&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you’ve never covered big O in an &lt;strong&gt;academic setting&lt;/strong&gt;, you &lt;strong&gt;can probably&lt;/strong&gt; skip this subsection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Academics use big 0, big 0 (theta), and big O (omega) to describe runtimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;industry&lt;/strong&gt; (and &lt;strong&gt;therefore in interviews&lt;/strong&gt;), people seem to have merged 0 and O together. Industry’s meaning of big O is closer to what academics mean by 0, in that it would be seen as incorrect to describe printing an array as O(N&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Industry would just say this is O(N).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For this book, we will use big O in the way that &lt;strong&gt;industry tends&lt;/strong&gt; to use it: By always trying to offer the tightest description of the runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree to some of these statements but I also think that it depends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry may use O(N) as an approximation but they will definitely check if it is not O(N&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) by accident. They will definitely do so if money is involved. In other words, while the industry may use O(N) as an approximation, they definitely know how to get to the O(N&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) boundary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, dear reader, spend the time and learn. This way you can adjust your answer based on your audience and you can understand. Plus, it is actually helpful when you are making things.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Swift package manager and links</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/swift-package-manager-october-2018"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I do not have a lot of time left for today. Instead of spending time grinding leetcode for the interviews, I wanted to study swift package manager (SPM). I am wanting to explore Swift and Java as my main [scripting/everything] language(s) moving forward. I’ve never tried SPM before and I’ve been using Swift for almost a year now (come November). So, I figured I should give it a shot and I even had an idea to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem-statement&quot;&gt;Problem Statement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time I write this piece of content, I have to name this file. I have a specific way I name these files: It goes &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;date-title.markdown&lt;/code&gt; so it is easier for me to reference in the future. When the parser does its magic, it also creates a nice, seo friendly URL that I can share. It gives some context to readers that are reading it right now in October 2018. If you look at the link, you know that it is a fresh article without even reading it ;-) People like me like to read things like this. While it is fine to do it manually once in a while, it became too repetative to me. SPM to the rescue!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;idea&quot;&gt;Idea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a cli tool using SPM that can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;take input from cli&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;input like : &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$ tool &quot;Swift package manager october 2018&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and provide output to me so I can copy/paste while I am creating a new file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… oh and I get to write something today ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// main.swift&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Foundation&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;CommandLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;guard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;isEmpty&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Need some kind of arguments fam&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;EXIT_FAILURE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//let input = &quot;Will end-user applications ever be truly programmable?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;inputLowerCased&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;lowercased&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//print(input)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;dashifyText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;inputTxt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;guard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inputTxt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;isEmpty&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;currDateTime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and in the process, I’ve tried different things. The struggles were real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NSError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;domain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;my error description&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;userInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ui1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ui2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;val2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stringSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SubSequence&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;filteredStr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;splitStr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;:&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and if you actually ran this script then you may notice that it doesn’t exactly create the same URL that you currently see. I had to remove the time from the file name. My actual naming convention is to use days for the files and within the files I have a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;datePublished&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dateModified&lt;/code&gt; timestamps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ran this script it would make something like this as output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;// current output
2018-10-04-23-39-swift-package-manager-october-2018.markdown
// what we need
2018-10-04-swift-package-manager-october-2018.markdown
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is almost there. I will modify it for me and I will leave this up to you if you care as an exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying something different here today with you. I am a bit more raw and transparent. I usually wouldn’t have posted the code above. I definitely would have edited it before publishing it. But that is not the point of this exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I am attempting to do here is two things at once:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;going off on a random idea and implementing it just because — a challenge;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;playing with Swift and seeing where that takes me;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to finish off, I will list the links that I have open for today in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Will end-user applications ever be truly programmable?</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/will-end-user-applications-ever-be-truly-programmable"/>
   <updated>2018-10-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/will-end-user-applications-ever-be-truly-programmable</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, I’ve noticed a trend that I’m starting to accummulate a running list of blogs, articles, and people that I find interesting. A list that I curate and maintain manually — a practice that everyone prior to SAAS explosion used to be intimately familiar with: using bookmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why am I going back to doing this? I jumped in just like everyone else on the social media train that started moving in the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this train moved further away from the station, I noticed that I changed the way I interacted with information. Instead of saving things locally on my computer, I would off-load it to the cloud. At first, it made it very convenient for myself: I wouldn’t need to worry about hard-drive crashes or lost information. Even then — a failing hard-drive almost never crossed my mind during my day-to-day uses even if I was mindful of its risk. I finally knew where I could find anything. No more plugging in different hard drives and searching for my things. (and storage capacities at prices that I could not afford previously).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the technology improved and added things I did not know I was missing. Specifically — the sharing and collaborating features. The cloud ecosystems enabled the possibility of sharing interesting information with others. Most importantly, it allowed for asynchronous (and real-time) working experience with others and paved the remote work movement. In other words, saving things locally was a thing of the past. Archaic. Everything. Always. Stayed somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems? What problems? All of our problems went away we were told by marketers. Previously, if I shared information with someone there were many variables involved in the process: from compressing, to transfer, to uptime, and so on. Now, there were no more problems. If you cannot get my shared documents then something is wrong on your end; with the way you are doing things. Run into a problem? One could simply point people to most common problems list, or a faqs, or a helpful video and thus reduce the amount of time spent on such stressors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what happened? Too much comfort and reliance in the spoon feeding. The non-stop flow from the infinite social media feed algorithms got into my daily routines. Why should I be looking for information? I’ll let that be fed to me based on the way I interact with things. I stopped being actively involved in this search. I relied too much on the feed algorithms. I got lazy and falsely expected good quality news to flow to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… and it worked. But boy did this approach ever backfire on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I did not consider is the historical perspective. During my regular day-to-day usage, the social feed works well once you jump into that water. However, if you are like me and like to reference things at random times, then this approach starts to break. The infinite feed is not really productive especially if there is no predictable order to it. Moreover, you could run into an issue of not finding things in the future. This is especially prevelent if you are an early adopter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the unicorns, if the business is still around, experienced their fair share of messing with user’s data unintentionally. Be it permission to the data access, persistence of the data or lack of it, recovery of the data, pricing structures, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can a random user be confident in a random service? Will the data be available to the user in the future? Will you be able to access the data? How much access will you have? For how long? How do you export the data? Can you? Should you? How do you share the knowledge with a friend? Someone who is outside of your wall? Will there be a good relationship between the business and the user? Does the relationship change if you pay?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am questioning if it is fair of us as consumers to be asking things that we want to be asking of technology giants. I am also questioning if we have any good examples of great businesses left in software? Examples that a random person on the street may be familiar with and not the outliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok… now that you have some background I will move on to the why I even started typing this piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine me a few days ago when I stumbled upon a random website. I started reading the content and saw that it was written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://patrickcollison.com/&quot;&gt;Patrick Collison&lt;/a&gt; — the one from &lt;a href=&quot;Stripe.com&quot;&gt;Stripe.com&lt;/a&gt;. He brought up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://patrickcollison.com/questions&quot;&gt;few interesting points&lt;/a&gt; that I did not consider regarding our (user’s) interaction with software. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Will end-user applications ever be truly programmable? If so, how?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Emacs, Smalltalk, Genera, and VBA embody a vision of malleable end-user computing: if the application doesn’t do what you want, it’s easy to tweak or augment it to suit your purposes. &lt;strong&gt;Today, however, end-user software increasingly operates behind bulletproof glass&lt;/strong&gt;. This is especially true in the growth areas: mobile and web apps. Furthermore, not only is it getting &lt;strong&gt;harder to manipulate&lt;/strong&gt; the application logic itself, but it’s also becoming &lt;strong&gt;harder to directly manipulate&lt;/strong&gt; your data. With Visual Basic, you can readily write a quick script to calculate some calendar analytics with Outlook. &lt;strong&gt;To do the same with Google Calendar is a very laborious chore&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;End-user computing is becoming less a bicycle and &lt;strong&gt;more a monorail&lt;/strong&gt; for the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As a consequence, &lt;strong&gt;we need ever more domain-specific software&lt;/strong&gt;. Rather than use universal tools for handling charts and for manipulating data, we tend to use separate analytics packages for every conceivable application. This is not all bad. Domain-specific tools can maximize ease-of-use and help amortize the cost of complex, specialized functionality. Sublime’s built-in ⌘-T works better than every third-party Emacs package. Still, despite these benefits, the popularity of macros and browser plugins strongly suggest that &lt;strong&gt;users are smart and want more control&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Should we just give up on our earlier visions of empowered users or is a better equilibrium possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quote above (with my own highlights) was retrieved on October 3, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very interesting perspective Patrick. A view that I am glad you shared and definitely will make me think in the future. More specifically, I did not see what kind of doors something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications&quot;&gt;VBA&lt;/a&gt; opened for everyone. With VBA, a user has the ability to play while avoiding 3rd party reliance. This was probably huge when it came about to the customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m afraid to admit that I used to think: why on earth would you use VBA in 2016? 2017? 2018? Well, if you are stuck and have nothing else at your disposal, it surely looks like a really good tool to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to remember and put yourself in that context. A context of a typical worker that is constrained by an administrator. In such a situation, usually, everything is turned off by default (because risk mitigation strategy). This way, if you need something to be turned on or installed then then need to submit a service request. You basically need to cry for help. Moreover, things like cost, licensing, needs, and wants come into play during such a request. These things require justification. Because, business after-all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are in such a unique position and you are constrained, then you may need to get creative. How do you solve such a problem? Create your own shortcuts. See a repetitive tasks? Automate it. Boring task? Automate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how can you do this automation? Lots of creative approaches, say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;buy an automaton thing or get creative with something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com/&quot;&gt;Zapier&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifttt.com/&quot;&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt; products&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ask coworker to see what they would do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ask your boss and see what they say&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;research and see what tools are available to you (at your level) or your boss&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open up a browser and the developer’s console -&amp;gt; JavaScript to the rescue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OR you could simply&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learn &amp;amp; use VBA (that is already installed on your environment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem solved!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take a step back, suppose you go back four years ago to 2014, then I am not sure if I would have even written this article. You have to remember that technology moves fast. But I can definitely assure you that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;open up a browser and the developer's console -&amp;gt; JavaScript to the rescue&lt;/code&gt; definitely would not have been up there as a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript wasn’t where it is now. If your only option was Internet Explorer then you definitely did not enjoy JavaScript. There was a lot of lapses (language features and browser support). I definitely never imagined seeing something like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; in my browser’s console. Heck, your development tools that are packed in your web browser weren’t where they are now in October of 2018. I am not even talking about other significant improvements done over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my take away was an interesting one. I can understand and appreciate the importance of being creative within software constraints a little bit more. I can open up my Excel 2013 and create a macro to do pretty much what I want it to do. It just works and I can be a little bit more productive. If I wanted to do something similar with Google Sheets hypothetically, I would probably have to sign up for a new service and transfer some of my data along the way. Thus, perpetuating the moving of your data throughout the Internet while leaving little crumbs along the way. Is it bad? Is it good? Are these the right questions? Depends on model and the simulation I suppose ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I am also glad to see impactful people asking important questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>October 2018 Challenge</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/october-2018-challenge"/>
   <updated>2018-10-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/october-2018-challenge</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve decided to do a few challenges for the month of October:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;do at least 1 problem on leetcode per day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;write and publish 1 thing per day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few minutes ago, I was having a blast while fighting with the following maintenance that I am undergoing for &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailyvibes.ca&quot;&gt;daily vibes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018-10-02/xcode-battles.png&quot; alt=&quot;Xcode decided to not play along&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While customers do not care about such background things, I am beginning to see what people mean about upgrade headaches. And, thus, I stopped for today. No more wasting time on lower priority things. I then proceeded to write instead. I wanted to say two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am trying really hard to stay committed to the problem solving challenge. Not going to lie right now — not looking forward to it right now but I am looking forward to looking back at this time and laughing about it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Writing something every day and then publishing it is, also, not going to be easy. It is an experiment for me that I hope you enjoy whenever you read this. Perhaps, you will see what improvements can occur through deliberate practice in just a few days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Discrete Mathematics For Computer Science</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/on-discrete-mathematics-for-computer-science"/>
   <updated>2018-10-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/on-discrete-mathematics-for-computer-science</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just ran into &lt;a href=&quot;http://condor.depaul.edu/sepp/ICME-13.Epp.pdf&quot;&gt;“Discrete Mathematics For Computer Science”&lt;/a&gt; by Susanna S. Epp (13th International Congress on Mathematical Education Hamburg, 24-31 July 2016). The piece resonated with me and I decided to note some reflections from my own experience down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I added my own emphasis to the quotes below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The material in discrete structures is pervasive in the areas of data structures and algorithms but &lt;strong&gt;appears elsewhere&lt;/strong&gt; in computer science as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This statement resonates very well with me. During my education, there was a big emphasis on data structures and importance of maths in &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; field. However, there was almost no time spent on the &lt;em&gt;appears elsewhere&lt;/em&gt; part of my studies. This left me frustrated lots of times primarily because I went into software engineering to learn about the application of theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also how I know about Susanna S. Epp and her book &lt;em&gt;Discrete Mathematics with Applications by Susanna S. Epp&lt;/em&gt;. When I found my education exposure was lacking, I started to search for different strategies to learn difficult material. It turns out, if you add a little bit of effort, then you can find an author in your field of interest that can help you learn this challenging material. An author that writes in a way that you can understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it is one thing that nobody talks about when you are having a difficult time understanding. The fact that if you are having a hard time studying, then a different solution or approach is needed for you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if you know that other approaches exist&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if you look hard for it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if you take an initiative to self-study&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and self-research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[…] an ability to create and understand a proof — either a formal symbolic proof or a less formal but still mathematically rigorous argument—is important in virtually every area of computer science, including (to name just a few) formal specification, verification, databases, and cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[g]raph theory concepts are used in networks, operating systems, and compilers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Set theory concepts are used in software engineering and in databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Probability theory is used in intelligent systems, networking, and a number of computing applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while I do understand the reference points and examples — I only do so because I went through the system. Looking backwards, when I was learning at the beginning, I recall a big emphasis on data structures and graphs. However, there was no justification besides rote memorization and &lt;strong&gt;needing it for this degree&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This paper explores three reasons for the problem. One is that there has been a reduced emphasis on mathematical proof in the secondary mathematics curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally that was true in my experience. This subject matter was never fully conveyed to me - how proofs form the building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A study of teacher attitudes by Knuth (2002) indicated that the teachers “viewed proof as appropriate for the mathematics education of a minority of students” and that they saw proof “as a &lt;strong&gt;topic of study&lt;/strong&gt; rather than as a &lt;strong&gt;tool for communicating and studying mathematics&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeap… ding ding ding. That’s how it was conveyed to me in Canadian school system as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A second is that the &lt;strong&gt;ways certain words and phrases&lt;/strong&gt; are interpreted &lt;strong&gt;in ordinary speech&lt;/strong&gt; often differ from the ways they must be interpreted in formal, deductive reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot tell you how much I struggled with this. The cognitive collusion between ordinary speech and formal reasoning. It is tough to get your head around the complicated subject matter. It really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And these things follow you if you do not grasp them when first learning. As someone who had no English vocabulary, I was studying the new language in parallel as I was getting my education foundation and going through the education system. Not only does it make studying these concepts confusing, it also makes the entire field of Maths as some type of mountain that you cannot climb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of my time memorizing content without understanding. While this approach works to some degree, it almost always fails as you get higher up the knowledge ladder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I did not realize, at the time that I was struggling, was that the road blocks should have signaled to me that I had foundational issues. Instead, I plowed forward without having the full picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand this now and it is part of the reason why I read up on things like this in my free time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of their tasks as students is to learn how to extract the standard interpretation from what is said and written. One of the tasks of instructors is to teach them how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;100% did not experience this. In all of my experience so far the instructors believed in rote replication via writing. While this may work for some learning styles, it really did not work for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One example is that in everyday speech if-then is frequently interpreted as if-and-only-if.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I find this confusing? Check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Only-if is also routinely interpreted as if-and-only-if.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I find this confusing? Check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In propositional logic the negation of “if A then B” is the conjunction “A and not B,” …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I find this confusing? Check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a bit hard to reflect on this now because I am much more familiar with this subject. But I will try to step back and play around with my thoughts. The author mentions that students seem to reply &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;if A then not B&lt;/code&gt; as the common solution to the negation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I can justify that response in my head, my brain wants to say &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;if not A then not B&lt;/code&gt; but it definitely doesn’t think &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;not A or B&lt;/code&gt; nor &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;not A and B&lt;/code&gt;. Sure, I know the theory and I know about truth tables. And, if I force myself then I can definitely come up to the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what I am saying is that it is still challenging to think about these things when you have mental clashes with your everyday speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For instance, a natural response to “If John comes, then the party will be a disaster” is “Don’t worry. If John comes, then the party will not be a disaster. It will be fine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This takes the language issue a bit further:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to the rules of predicate logic, when a statement contains &lt;strong&gt;two different quantifiers&lt;/strong&gt;, they should be interpreted in &lt;strong&gt;left-right order&lt;/strong&gt;. However in ordinary language a statement with both for-all and there-is is typically interpreted in &lt;strong&gt;whatever way makes the most common sense&lt;/strong&gt;. Linguists call this “scope ambiguity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For example, the most natural way to interpret the sentence, “There is a lid for every pot” is as “For every pot there is a lid” not as “There is one single lid that will be fit every pot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A third is the difficulties students experience in understanding and using statements involving variables, both in connection with predicate logic and in interpreting certain kinds of mathematical phrases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very true but to me, this stems from issue created in #2 regarding language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked the following examples provided in the piece:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What we say — What we mean
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;the value of x — the quantity that is put in place of
x&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;as the value of x increases — as larger and larger numbers are put in place of x&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;As the value of x increases, the value of y increases. — If larger and larger numbers are put in place of x, the corresponding numbers that are put in place of y become larger and larger
.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;where x is any real number — for all possible substitutions of real numbers in place of x&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Let n be any even number — Imagine substituting an integer in place of n but &lt;strong&gt;do not assume anything about its value&lt;/strong&gt; except that it is an even integer
.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;By definition of even, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;n = 2k&lt;/code&gt; for some integer &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; — By definition of even, there is an integer we can substitude in place of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; so that the equation &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;n = 2k&lt;/code&gt; will be true. (In fact, there is only one such integer; its value is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;n/2&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;the function &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x^2&lt;/code&gt; — the function that relates each real number to the square of that number. In other words, for each possible substitution of a real number in place of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, the function corresponds to the square of that number.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;where &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is some real number that satisfies the given property — There is a real number that will make the given property true if we substitude it in place of x.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I respect the author and the work she does, it appears that math education is a loosing battle. I skimmed through author’s article from 1987 (The Logic of Teaching Calculus. In Toward a Lean and Lively Calculus: Report of the Conference Workshop to Develop Curriculum and Teaching Methods for Calculus at the College Level. Ronald G. Douglas, Ed. Washington, D.C.: Mathematical Association of America, 1987, 41-59.) where she outlined similar concerns around logic (only that time it was in the context of calculus).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been more than 30 years and it appears that new students are continuing to struggle with maths. Anecdotally, I hear concerned systems and parents pushing for programming skills while pushing away core maths. If you found math challenging or confusing I encourage you not to give up. You can study it on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start your studies wherever you got confused. There are tests available that can help you narrow it down. Start from grade 1 if you want to. Who is going to judge? Open up khan academy and go to town. Discover the beauty and study on your own time… I did (and I still am).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it wasn’t for Khan Academy, self-studying, youtube, and the people of the internet in general — I am not sure if I would be where I am.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>More frequent updates</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/more-frequent-updates"/>
   <updated>2018-09-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/more-frequent-updates</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Those of you that know me personally, know that I do a lot of little experiments and I like to reflect. I believe in engineering and science principles. They are at my core and drive me forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I feel like I am not doing a good job in reflecting and sharing that with you. What happens usually is that I open up a blank canvas, such as this one, and just start writing. Usually I have a topic or a direction that motivates me to write. However, I do not consider if I will publish or delete the content at the time of writing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I mean by a blank canvas in September 2018:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018-09-28/Screen-Shot-2018-09-29-at-12.12.33.png&quot; alt=&quot;Blank canvas&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, I have a lot of written content spread out across various computers, domains, and publications. A lot of this content is not published and, if taken out of context, may seem like a waste of my time. Personally, I find it very difficult to hit that publish button for many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, writing is cathartic in a sense — the single purpose is to remove the content from my head. When the ideas are out of my head and on a canvas then I can play with them. In my head there is chaos, so I like to consolidate my ideas and to make sense of them. To tease out my views and opinions (and to correct them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take this into consideration, then perhaps you can see why some of my pieces don’t get my approval and thus never see the light. However, the longer I live on this earth, the more I wish I didn’t hold back and just publish (whether or not it is finished). So, I decided to actively work on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my goals for 2018 was to publish more frequent written updates. The intention was not only to improve the quality of my written content but also to documenting a process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is the end of September. Month #9 is almost done. So how have I been doing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole, I have been doing way better than any of my previous years. If you take a look at this year alone, I have published 11 pieces of work so far. Some of them even required a lot of additional work. Gasp!!! One thing for sure — I have been staying consistent. Whatever that means to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I take a look at it this way, then my progress is happening. I am growing and developing. However, during my day-to-day thinking it feels more negative. I feel like I could be doing better in this area. I still find myself falling into the trap of not publishing. Reflecting on this progress definitely helps to stay on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I think I am doing OK even if it doesn’t feel like that. I give myself the permission to make mistakes, publish more frequent and unfinished work; and continue this journey that I started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-happened-since-the-last-post&quot;&gt;What happened since the last &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/i-have-to-come-clean-about-my-project&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in June/July/August, I finished the backend &amp;amp; frontend MVP for dailyvibes
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;the said backend and frontend are not live yet to anyone but you may see some things &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dailyvibes&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;PS, as an aside — I am considering migrating away from github to self-hosted for all of my work&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in July, worked on &lt;a href=&quot;https://screenhole.net/&quot;&gt;screenhole&lt;/a&gt; and created an MVP for a Mac OS screen recorder functionality. That was a fun experiment that you can view at &lt;a href=&quot;https://screenhole.net/getaclue/~g8U2vv&quot;&gt;https://screenhole.net/getaclue/~g8U2vv&lt;/a&gt; Unfortunately that is not a public feature and is stuck in alpha/beta stage until further notice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in July/August, worked on &lt;a href=&quot;https://keyframes.net/&quot;&gt;keyframes&lt;/a&gt; native Mac app. Was a bit of work but looks nice in my opinion. This work is in &lt;a href=&quot;https://keyframes.net/snapper/beta&quot;&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt; and is available for download.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in August, launched our &lt;a href=&quot;https://cspray.ca/&quot;&gt;physical product&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theex.com/&quot;&gt;Canadian National Exhibition&lt;/a&gt;. That was intense. Will talk about this more at a later time ;-) but lets just say we are continuing working on this project. This was a FIRST for us and also a BIG deal!!!
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Attendance: 1.54 million (2016)&lt;/code&gt; — may hint to you at why. And we made sure to talk to almost everyone that passed by us. I say almost because it was just the two of us.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in September, started to work on news article parser for &lt;a href=&quot;https://elderoost.com/&quot;&gt;elderoost&lt;/a&gt;. One of the current challenges is keeping up to news. I physically read all of the articles manually and filter them manually. This honestly takes a lot of time. If you check the website the latest article was added &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;5 months ago&lt;/code&gt;. I have all of the articles since then I just haven’t processed them yet.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;current working approach:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;get news article link&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;go to the link&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;grab the URL, title, headline, author, date of publication, and the content
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;I found a script that helps with grabbing all of this (similar to how some browsers allow you to have a read an html page in plain text if you click a button)&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;put this stuff into postgres db&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;index title and content using elasticsearch&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;for each residence search against this text&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;unfortunately it is not done as I cannot narrow down some edge cases.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-what-am-i-up-to-now&quot;&gt;and what am I up to now?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;job search
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;After 2 years and some, I think it is time as there aren’t any new opportunities for growth as a software engineer where I am&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The work moved to a new physical location that is more challenging to commute to&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;My school debt is causing me a lot of stress and anxiety… so I’d like to pay this off faster.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I am not being paid what I know I could be for someone with my needed skills
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;I stayed because of the team but that recently got dissolved&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cspray&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;dailyvibes
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;add user auth functionality on ios
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;make user auth functionality work between ios and server&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;make a sync mechanism between ios and server (probably manual for now and then automate)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;modify the way you share links within iOS (add a new area so it is easier to share)
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;share these links from iOS to server (after the user stuff is linked up)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;provision a server on DO or Linode
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;glue the backend &amp;amp; frontend on this server&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;glue the server to dailyvibes domain&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;elderoost
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;finish news article parser&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;add a notifyer after this is done to manually review&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;figure out monetization&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… in that order I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m going to spend the next little while grinding cracking the coding interview bible and all of the typical hackerrank websites. It is a bit unfortunate that I need to put a pause on the side projects to do this. But it is what it is. (Especially if you want to work for the typical Fortune N company.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for those of you that finished reading this, here is some behind the scenes context to this article. It is an example of a written piece that I ended up &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/would-you-let-your-mother-use-your-software&quot;&gt;publishing&lt;/a&gt;. It started off as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hemingwayapp.com/&quot;&gt;Hemingway app&lt;/a&gt; draft and then, eventually, I approved and transformed it into an article.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I have to come clean about my project</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/i-have-to-come-clean-about-my-project"/>
   <updated>2018-06-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/i-have-to-come-clean-about-my-project</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have something to tell you and come clean about. I haven’t touched my beloved dailyvibes code base since April. And if I am being completely honest, I kind of lost steam in March. (To give you some context, I started thinking about the project in October and working on it last November. Since November I tried to ship something every 2 weeks.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything was fine until about March. In March, I felt that I did not like where I was going, I was having a bad time, and I was losing project’s direction. I even had thoughts of abandoning it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also knew that my app was stable enough for people to use. Thus, if I was about to abandon my work then at least people would not lose their data. These thoughts allowed me to slow down and to reflect. Afterall, I still care about the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/klf5jH+&quot; alt=&quot;you're going to have a bad time image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I start thinking this way about a project, I become aware that it is a good time to step back and reflect. In other words, it is a good time to see if my time is worth investing into a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, I wanted to figure out what was causing me to feel this way. I narrowed it down to the following three issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-i-was-facing-technical-issues&quot;&gt;1. I was facing technical issues.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/ai0zYr+&quot; alt=&quot;subject to technical issues - free image from https://pixabay.com/en/problem-technical-issues-technology-1951987/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I work solo, I did not want to spend my limited time on things that do not move the project forward (in the users eyes). But, it got to a point where I needed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.briantracy.com/blog/time-management/the-truth-about-frogs/&quot;&gt;eat that frog&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of the challenges that comes with indie work. You wear many hats. You are playing the role of a product manager and have to decide on what to work on. Sometimes you have to do the work that you do not want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-i-was-not-happy-with-the-direction-of-the-project&quot;&gt;2. I was not happy with the direction of the project.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/DMndPx+&quot; alt=&quot;lost found searching - image from https://pixabay.com/en/lost-found-lost-and-found-searching-1605501/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the project, I needed to do some market research. I needed to check if this project was worth my interest and time. How did I do my market research? Well, it was very simple. I downloaded all the productivity / todo apps from the Apple App Store and I played with each one of them. I noted down ideas that I liked and things that I did not like. But, by doing that, my phone looks like this now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d.pr/v/CtydOz&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/b8PU7m+&quot; alt=&quot;my ios screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After playing with each app, I’ve come to realize that most of the apps do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means to the users is that they have a lot of choice in this saturated category of productivity. In otherwords, they can switch from my product much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means to me is that I don’t need to stress on competing. I was aligning dailyvibes with other similar apps. This process made me bored and stopped using the app. Dailyvibes started because I was not happy of the solutions. Instead I will focus on building features that will be useful to the end user and to me. I will focus on the product and its quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I took a step back and recorded the actions that I do every day. I interact with the following data structures: tasks to complete today, notes/text snippets, links/bookmarks, gifs / images and photos. One thing that kind of doesn’t fit is positive thoughts / quotes. I need to think some on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I will work on integrating these things into dailyvibes and thus forcing me to dogfood my own app. What will make all these things work together is some kind of linking mechanism. I will definitely polish this as time moves on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, users have so much choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-i-did-not-know-what-direction-apple-will-take-mac-os-apps-in&quot;&gt;3. I did not know what direction Apple will take Mac OS apps in.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/LE7TsI+&quot; alt=&quot;marzipan rumours&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next biggest feature for dailyvibes is to create a server component. Which will be then followed by a syncing mechanism of some sort between the server and iOS app. Both of these components, would position me well to create either a a desktop companion app or a web app. I chose to wait until June to make this decision because of WWDC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could not decide if I wanted to leverage the iCloud ecosystem and have apple do all the legwork or me. I’ve investigated both options. I decided to roll out my own for three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I know how,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want to practice for my personal project, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want to have control over my data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that these decisions will also benefit the users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also could not decide if I wanted to spend time on a native Mac desktop app or on a web app. I am familiar with web but I am very new to the Mac. I investigated both options. I am deciding, at least for now, to focus on the web app component because I am more familiar with that. Plus, Apple admitted that there will be changes to Mac OS next year. I’ll revisit native Mac app next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is nice to step back and reflect on how far you’ve come with a project. It is good to be mindful. Albeit, I will be first to admit that it is challenging to talk about your project when it is not going as you expect. I am, once again excited, to keep working on the project and I have a better vision moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a nice feeling when you are happy with your decisions. Also, the organic discovery isn’t that bad either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/MLstRV+&quot; alt=&quot;Q1 results&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/dHUliO+&quot; alt=&quot;Q2 results&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re making something, you have to be the first to believe in success of your thing. Do one thing every day that moves the project forward. Everything else will [hopefully] work itself out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and until next time,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Would you let your mother use your software?</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/would-you-let-your-mother-use-your-software"/>
   <updated>2018-05-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/would-you-let-your-mother-use-your-software</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Would you let your mother use your software?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/V8kt2K&quot; alt=&quot;Oh and I am not trying to single anyone out in this photo btw&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How about your father? sister? brother? wife? husband? fiancé? grandparents? neighbour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I can immediate hear some of you say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;But Alex … you would say …&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;… they would never &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; my software… they are not my &lt;em&gt;target audience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Or… I would teach them how to use my software properly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Or… I would never let them use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, my dear friend, I would ask that you play along with me in this exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose that the use of your software became mandatory. Suppose your friend or family member had no help or training from you. Suppose they were that user number #1110101 that you did not want to deal with. Take your pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Are you following along?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are following, at what I am trying to say here, then I hope you can answer yes to my original question with some degree of confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no… you cannot use the typical engineering answer of “it depends”. Sorry, I want a binary response here: yes or no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if your answer is a no then I hope that you might start thinking about these important issues. For example, you could start thinking about why are you leaning towards no? Perhaps, what can you do today to increase your level of confidence? Because you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you call yourself a scientist or an engineer? Do you have some variation of this title? Are you proud to call yourself that? Does it define who you are on a day-to-day basis? If so then you must think about ethics. It is your duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But maybe this belief is naive? Maybe this is not how it works in the real world? Maybe being associated with those things is not enough for such heavy consideration? Maybe we should leave ethics to someone else? We make software to solve some problem and that’s that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too often I see the answer that it is not applicable to me or my work. Too often I see ambivalence and lack of professional care. To me, this cannot be the winning formula moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been following software development for the past few years, then you’ve noticed a certain trend by now. A trend of malpractice if you will. Followed by a trend of acceptance or standardization towards such malpractice. And if you dig a little deeper into these trends — they are often, but not always, connected to some lapse in ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you’re of the mind that ethics and business [and software] cannot mix — I call for you to reconsider and have a conversation. I hope the pressure of shareholders and funding money does not blind your mission or your vision. Try to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just because you can do something, should you?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you should, then how can you do so while being ethical?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you cannot remain ethical, then the least you can do is own it. Don’t deny it. You are a professional, aren’t you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps our approach to ethics needs a pivot?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maybe ethics, as a field, is too broad of a topic? Too abstract and not applicable?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maybe, it is time to reframe our delivery on ethics?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time to step back and reduce the scope so that we can understand better?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is me — trying to do that for you. Next time you are working on software just give it a shot and ask yourself this relatable question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;would you let your &lt;strong&gt;_&lt;/strong&gt; use your software?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll let you fill in the blank. Don’t be lazy and do make it relatable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it because your answer should be yes with some level of confidence. It is 2018 and I am trying to take a gradual approach to this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are use a lot of software every single day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And guess what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is only the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just wait until the entire planet, and everyone on it, gets a reliable high speed connection. It is not if but when.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;PS: I know that I am throwing generalities and I hope you can forgive me for the point that I am trying to illustrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;PPS: Sorry for the clickbait title — but how else am I going to get you to read about software ethics? Not trying to single out mothers or family members or friends. I am trying to make a point that you should make your work relatable. Think about your end user. There is an actual person sitting on the other side of your code. And guess what? This person is trusting you and your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/oV4Piy&quot; alt=&quot;Image for the post&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi friends,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;before-we-begin&quot;&gt;Before we begin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I begin, I am assuming you are already running your UITests using &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastlane.tools/&quot;&gt;fastlane.tools&lt;/a&gt;. If not, I would suggest that you get yourself familiarized &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/screenshots/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It saves you lots of time and it is especially indispensable for solo developers like myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-this-article-about&quot;&gt;What is this article about?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is about improving your iOS marketing material: the screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we will go from this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/FuVdCb+&quot; alt=&quot;Starting point&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/7vkqhx+&quot; alt=&quot;Goal of this article&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be using &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastlane.tools/&quot;&gt;fastlane.tools&lt;/a&gt; in combination with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shinydevelopment/SimulatorStatusMagic&quot;&gt;SimulatorStatusMagic&lt;/a&gt; library. SimulatorStatusMagic is used to create the perfect status bar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;9:41 AM is displayed for the time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The battery is full and shows 100%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On iPhone: The carrier text is removed, 5 bars of cellular signal and full WiFi bars are displayed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On iPad: The carrier text is set to “iPad” and full WiFi bars are displayed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text above is taken verbatim from the library’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shinydevelopment/SimulatorStatusMagic&quot;&gt;description&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-would-you-want-to-do-that&quot;&gt;Why would you want to do that?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, such attention to detail adds extra value to your product by making your marketing material that much better than your competition. If you take a second to scan the Apple App store, the top apps provide some level of consistency in their marketing material. It follows, you should work towards achieving a similar level of consistency because it is not really not that hard. And if you set this up once, it will work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I wanted to the improve the screenshots that I use to market &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailyvibes.ca/&quot;&gt;Daily Vibes&lt;/a&gt; in my next update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-i-try&quot;&gt;What did I try?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installed SimulatorStatusMagic using cocoapods by adding the following line to my Podfile, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pod&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'SimulatorStatusMagic'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:configurations&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Debug'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I found the following &lt;a href=&quot;https://funkenstrahlen.de/blog/2016/04/21/perfekte-ios-screenshots/&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.scottlogic.com/2015/02/25/Using-Snapshot-with-Simulator-Status-Magic-to-generate-perfect-iOS-screenshots.html&quot;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; and they gave me good starting points. They were perfect for me because I wanted to use flags in my code like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/CVcNIW+&quot; alt=&quot;How I wanted to import the library&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would allow me to only import SimulatorStatusMagic during fastlane.tools run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, I also envisioned using this one flag throughout other areas of the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/M0QqzC+&quot; alt=&quot;What I envisioned&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So… putting it all together, I wanted something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/B53hS7+&quot; alt=&quot;How I wanted fastlane.tools and SimulatorStatusMagic to work&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But, I could not get it to run exactly like that 😭&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to get this to work. However, as a result of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/search?q=custom_args&amp;amp;type=Issues&amp;amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/4717&quot;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; you need some tweaking in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-is-my-curent-solution&quot;&gt;So what is my curent solution?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;import SimulatorStatusMagic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;leverage snapshot’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/screenshots/#advanced-snapshot&quot;&gt;launch arguments&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FASTLANE_SNAPSHOT&lt;/code&gt; is set to true&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;call in code as you wanted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rb highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;NSUserDefaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;standardUserDefaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;boolForKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;FASTLANE_SNAPSHOT&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;SDStatusBarManager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sharedInstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;enableOverrides&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;setupScreenshotData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the code above works … but I will be first to admit that it is not the perfect solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it is currently written, you will need to play the commenting game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;comment out import SimulatorStatusMagic and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;comment out SDStatusBarManager.sharedInstance().enableOverrides()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;during regular development and do the reverse during fastlane.tools run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So… during regular development:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/ptOZ9a+&quot; alt=&quot;What you have to do during regular development&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and … during fastlane.tools run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/DCDj9W+&quot; alt=&quot;What you have to do during fastlane.tools run&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I am familiar with Ruby and Swift, and can get by with Objective-C, I tried to make it work how I wanted and find the source of confusion. I did look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/xcodebuild.1.html&quot;&gt;xcodebuild arguments&lt;/a&gt; and scanned fastlane.tools source &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/snapshot/lib/snapshot/test_command_generator_base.rb#L34&quot;&gt;code up to here&lt;/a&gt;. But, since there is only so much time in the day and I work on this during my free time - I did not narrow down the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you have a different solution that allows me to run the code how I wanted, please reach out to me via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/getaclue_1&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;. I will gladly adjust this article to incorporate those changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I hope that you enjoy this working solution. I was puzzled during my research in 2018 and I did not see a solution so hopefully this helps someone in upping their screenshot game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Improving iOS performance with Xcode and Instruments for dummies</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/improving-ios-performance-with-xcode-and-instruments-for-dummies"/>
   <updated>2018-03-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/improving-ios-performance-with-xcode-and-instruments-for-dummies</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/eVxYjd&quot; alt=&quot;Image for the post&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi friend, is your app running a bit slow? Are you, perhaps, unsure what to do about it? Where do you start to investigate? Perhaps, like me, you started searching 🕵️‍️ in your code for something evident? (Only to realize that you are going down a never ending rabbit hole?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, stress not my friend because Xcode got you covered ✅ and it will help you find your issues (or put you on the right track at least).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a second article that I am writing about an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The more that I use Xcode, the more I like it 😎 Xcode is really, really awesome. Just give it a try and use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Side note: it &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; took me 182 hours to get to the Instruments panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m actually really surprised at the amount of tooling that is given to you in this wonderful IDE. My software engineering training gave me my introduction to IDEs via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/ide/&quot;&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://netbeans.org/&quot;&gt;NetBeans&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve spent years using those tools (and don’t get me wrong, they are powerful). But to be completely honest, to this day I will pick anything else but these two. They are ugly, clunky, and not intuitive 🌶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-did-i-type-that-paragraph-above&quot;&gt;Why did I type that paragraph above?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because if you have an aversion to IDEs and think that Xcode looks just like the other IDEs, then I am here to tell you that it really is not. Xcode &lt;em&gt;IS&lt;/em&gt; a pleasure to use and I use it every day. (&lt;em&gt;PS&lt;/em&gt;: If you are getting angry while reading this and saying &lt;strong&gt;!?Xcode sucks!?&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t get so upset. I will admit, it is not perfect.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;instruments&quot;&gt;Instruments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this powerful thingy, built on top of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTrace&quot;&gt;DTrace&lt;/a&gt;, that comes with Xcode. No need to install extra software. Just download Xcode once and you have everything you need. Don’t have internet connection or you don’t want to be connected? No worries, you can still DO your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah… I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_SOYcYBnGU&quot;&gt;this wonderful youtube video&lt;/a&gt; to get an introduction to Instruments. Apple ofcourse has their own documentation which you can get &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/InstrumentsUserGuide/index.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following text is basically my brief overview of Instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you open Instruments, it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/c280xV+&quot; alt=&quot;Xcode Instruments&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can launch Instruments like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/QiJqRR+&quot; alt=&quot;Opening Xcode instruments open&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/PtBZgx+&quot; alt=&quot;Opening Xcode Instruments&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I didn’t want to leave you waiting while my slow computer takes its time to compile and open up… but you get the idea)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you do next is kind of interesting. All of the icons that you see above represent the different kinds of tool that you can run on your application. (I think of this screen as a collection of apps for your app). Hopefully you will understand why I say &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of all of the available options, I’ve only gotten familiar with Activity Monitor, Allocations, Leaks, and Time Profiler. Oh yes, not only are these tools wonderful but the naming conventions are intuitive and grouped by colour. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity Monitor and Time Profiler are in blue. These blue thingys are used to monitor CPU stuffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allocations and Leaks are in orange. These orange thingys are used to monitor memory stuff. (Guess what this other orange Zombies thingy looks at? Did you guess RAM stuffs? Cool right!!!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering to yourself… all of these thingsys are cool sounding, so what? What do I do with them? Well the cool thing about these thingys is that you can just JUMP in and you will figure things out as you go. It is that easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest that you play with the other tools available. I am going to focus on the Time Profiler for the rest of this article. At this point in the learning, I found it to be the most useful for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time Profiler - I’ve been using this for…profiling… time? 🤷‍ Basically, I open it up and it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/yRulLi+&quot; alt=&quot;Time Profiler in Xcode&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be asking, now what? How about we hit that big Red Record button ⏺ ? Yup, and it will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/zElUrI+&quot; alt=&quot;Time Profiler after hitting record button in Xcode&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;now-what-&quot;&gt;Now what? 🤔&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you use your app! What Instruments, or should I say Time Profiler, does in the background is it samples your environment… Time Profiler &lt;em&gt;records&lt;/em&gt; what it sees your app is doing during a specific time interval. Makes sense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you have ever used software that has some kind of manipulation of a timeline, then you will be just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is a &lt;em&gt;snapshot&lt;/em&gt; of how your app behaves, or its environment:
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/GPnnjB+&quot; alt=&quot;Time Profiler Sample in Xcode&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;time profiler records many such samples at a regular interval over time:
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/cEMzNa+&quot; alt=&quot;Time Profiler time line in Xcode&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;until you press the stop button ofcourse:
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/A5InKH+&quot; alt=&quot;Time Profiler from start to stop in Xcode&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;now-what--1&quot;&gt;Now what? 🤔&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you get to take off your developer hat 🎩 and play a detective 🕵️‍ … for real… how cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are exploring the Timing Profiler, we are interesting in timing. You can open up (expand) the tree, that Xcode conveniently made for you, and go exploring 🗺. See which areas or which methods in your code take a long time. It very simple. Just click expand ⏬ and dive 🏊‍ in:
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/KohUC7+&quot; alt=&quot;Start exploring Time Profiler in Xcode&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-know-where-to-start-try-this&quot;&gt;Don’t know where to start? Try this:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click record&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Play with you app as regular user (try various uses case)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stop the recording&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And then… you can filter specific time intervals!! How cool is that?!?!?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of me recording as I create a new to-do in &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailyvibes.ca/&quot;&gt;dailyvibes&lt;/a&gt; and then filtering various time intervals.
You can really isolate the various time intervals, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/MDyrNo+&quot; alt=&quot;Example of using Time Profiler in Xcode&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, to filter you simple Click and Drag on the timeline… just like any other application with a timeline. It is just that simple. And, when you filter, if you notice, the tree changes. Thus you can really get into the nitty gritty details and find out your problems 🚧.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and… and… and you can SAVE this sampling and come back to it later:
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/QP4X3Z+&quot; alt=&quot;Saving Time Profiler in Xcode&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an actual example of me diving deep into the tree 🌲. When you find something juicy, like this:
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/G4H042+&quot; alt=&quot;Example of Time Profiler in Xcode&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can… double click on the method, and it will show you EXACTLY which lines 👀 of code that may be troubling:
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/IOa6qa+&quot; alt=&quot;Double clicking on a method in Time Profiler in Xcode&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it friends. I’d like you to take away three things from this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Xcode is pretty awesome 🔥&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be a digital detective 🕵️‍ and give Instruments a try&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be careful ❌ of premature optimization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you liked this, please let me know. I like hearing feedback so I can improve.
You can find me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/getaclue_1&quot;&gt;twitters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until next time,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: I hope I did not offend you with the *for dummies tagline. I love technical documents but I feel like they need a bit of flavour sometimes. I simply want this technical mumbo-jumbo to feel relatable and friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to call Javascript debugger from Xcode? Can you?</title>

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hi-friends&quot;&gt;Hi friends,&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/7zk3ZR&quot; alt=&quot;Daily Vibes Apple Store Screenshots&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a previous release of ⭐️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/id1332324033&quot;&gt;Daily Vibes&lt;/a&gt; 📲, version 1.3.0, I added a natural language date parser. What this basically means that if you enter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;appointment with my accountant tomorrow at 3 pm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⭐️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/id1332324033&quot;&gt;Daily Vibes&lt;/a&gt; 📲 will understand what you mean. This is all possible because of the wonderful work done on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/quire-io/SwiftyChrono&quot;&gt;SwiftyChrono&lt;/a&gt;. However, I shipped 🚢 it with some pending things that are needed to be taken care of with the library. Figured I would fix it later down the road since it seems to work as expected 😅&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I’ve decided to tackle the issues and help updating &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/quire-io/SwiftyChrono&quot;&gt;SwiftyChrono&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/WQSc8k&quot; alt=&quot;Github SwiftyChrono PR&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internally, SwiftyChrono uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/quire-io/SwiftyChrono/tree/master/Tests/SwiftyChronoTests/JS/en&quot;&gt;javascript&lt;/a&gt; for testing. After the upgrades, I wanted to make sure that the tests work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;javascript-core&quot;&gt;JavaScript [Core]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I began 👀 looking for issues ⛈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the issues was narrowed down to be in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/quire-io/SwiftyChrono/blob/55f7a642916c24637c8c22d656884c0681b3aa48/Tests/SwiftyChronoTests/JS/en/test_en.js#L1&quot;&gt;this area of the code&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/9mAyJg&quot; alt=&quot;Problem code image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you notice, it is just javascript that is being executed. I know javascript so it should be no problem to debug, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, for starters, how do you debug javascript that is executed from Xcode? How does Xcode run javascript? This leads you down the rabbit hole to find that Apple has nicely introduced &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore&quot;&gt;JavaScript Core&lt;/a&gt; internally (&lt;a href=&quot;http://nshipster.com/javascriptcore/&quot;&gt;more info&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sothe-tldr&quot;&gt;So…the tl;dr&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very easy. Apple has built a nice interaction between Xcode and Safari.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The credit for the following steps to this answer goes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/43916256&quot;&gt;Rakesh Yembaram&lt;/a&gt; on stackoverflow.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-open-safari-and-enable-developer-menu&quot;&gt;1. Open Safari and Enable Developer Menu&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open Safari&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enable the Develop menu by going to:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;“Preferences”&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;“Advanced”&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;“Show Develop menu in menu bar”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/mnewCo&quot; alt=&quot;Show Develop Menu in Menu Bar of Safari&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-enable-jscontext&quot;&gt;2. Enable JSContext&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go to Develop menu
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/fGg3fS&quot; alt=&quot;Develop menu in Safari&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find your simulator or computer agent and enable&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Automatically show web inspector for JSContexts&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Automatically pause connecting to JSContexts&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/EPq8qe&quot; alt=&quot;Enable JSContext in Safari&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/id1332324033?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1010lK7Y&quot;&gt;Download Daily Vibes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-re-run-project-in-xcode&quot;&gt;3. Re-run project in Xcode&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my example, I’m just going to simply add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;debugger&lt;/code&gt; keyword to the Javascript file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/d5zfNe&quot; alt=&quot;added debugger to source code&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then I press run on the tests
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/lpBPFQ&quot; alt=&quot;press run on Xcode test images&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and I wait until Safari does its the magic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/tLQhEf&quot; alt=&quot;safari doing magic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you go, hopefully now you can see that it is not that difficult to debug any javascript that your app might contain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading and until next time my friend.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;hi-friends&quot;&gt;Hi friends,&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can’t believe how quickly January and February came and went. I hope you’ve had a productive start to the year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;apple-store&quot;&gt;Apple Store&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I uploaded &lt;a href=&quot;https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/id1332324033?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1010lK7Y&quot;&gt;Daily Vibes&lt;/a&gt; to the Apple App Store simply because I wanted to have it out there rather than keep it under wraps. I figured I would add value to the software as I go. In retrospect, it was a good decision because it allowed me to find value quicker (as opposed to when I was working on the app under wraps).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After listening to some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/show-ih-daily-vibes-ios-80a69b4368&quot;&gt;feedback on IndieHackers&lt;/a&gt; I decided to start working on ASO (Apple Store Optimization). Signed up for Apple’s Ads. Signed up for their Affiliate program. Started researching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-have-learned-so-far&quot;&gt;What I have learned so far:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Title matters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Description matters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keywords matter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having screenshots ??? apparently matters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having a video ?? apparently matters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Description and other stuff that you have to fill in… doesn’t matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-else-i-have-learned&quot;&gt;What else I have learned?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What you actually put in any of those fields doesn’t really matter. Don’t get attached to your App name, App Description, Keywords or anything else to do with it. This is important for indie developers with no ad budget. Why? Because we want to be found so people use our software.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have a budget then you can pick your Branding carefully and you can ignore what I said above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So, while working on improving Daily Vibes I am also looking at improving my overall marketing. I am going to do it iteratively and learn along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-my-plan-of-attack&quot;&gt;What is my plan of attack?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improve title (Daily Vibes ➡️ Daily Vibes: Life Task Manager)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improve subtitle (Todo List &amp;amp; Life Day Organizer ➡️ To do list, life day organizer)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improve keywords; currently haven’t decided:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;to-do, list app, list maker, task list, todo list, list, task, todo, to do, life organizer, daily&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;todo,list,organizer,tracker,task,project,things,productivity,to do,to-do,keep,reminder,day planner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;life organizer, good vibes, daily tasks, daily office, daily calender,
daily lists, daily organizer, lists maker,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make screenshots localized with pretty text (via &lt;a href=&quot;fastlane.tools&quot;&gt;fastlane.tools&lt;/a&gt;) … something like:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/LcaVFa+&quot; alt=&quot;LocalizedScreenshot sample&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make AND edit AND upload a video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/cmP5EE+&quot; alt=&quot;Video WIP Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improve aforementioned screenshots&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improve aforementioned video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these ideas are up in the air while I am writing this post. I am hoping to ship them with next release, hopefully sometime next week. Then, I will have to wait and look at the analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of work goes behind the scenes for a single app. I am beginning to appreciate indie developers and their successful products. You really need to be comfortable with wearing ALL of the hats that make a successful business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, marketing is an uncharted area and I was hesitant to start learning it. But look at me now, I can make icons, promo videos, and start being strategic about growth. It is a journey that I am enjoying but it is challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also paved the road and did all of the necessary paper work to add in app subscriptions. Now I just gotta figure out my strategy in this area ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and in closing news, I wanted to keep to a somewhat relaxed 2 week shipping cycle… and so far I have been sticking to the schedule of regular updates =) I hope I can keep this up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading and until next time my friend.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ready to Submit</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/ready-to-submit"/>
   <updated>2018-01-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/ready-to-submit</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Happy Friday 👋&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is so easy to let this writing to get out of hand even though I promised to write more regularly. I’ve been chugging along with a lot of things since last update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am still have trouble understanding how to use TestFlight&lt;/em&gt;. I have done quite a bit of work over the past few days and I wanted to release it to the beta testers. However, I am currently stuck in this state:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/7jVbKS/Vve27WMfts+&quot; alt=&quot;Stuck on these TestFlights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/Ade4Dd/XZMSnuzKCa+&quot; alt=&quot;TestFlight Stuck on Ready to Submit Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically I am stuck just like this person that wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/q/44716499&quot;&gt;TestFlight build on iTunes Connect stuck at ‘Ready to Submit’&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve contacted some fellow iOS developers and am now doing what they suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did I learn from them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;every new application version gets a review that you need to go through (which is exactly what is happening now from what I understand). I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://semver.org&quot;&gt;semver&lt;/a&gt;, so technically this would be a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1.0.2&lt;/code&gt; version. It has been primarily bug fixes and UI changes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;every new build, under a reviewed version, does not have to go through this process (apparently). So, this is what I am currently trying:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/8G17N9/9OFVGZcfuV+&quot; alt=&quot;Trying to make the app live&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While, I am waiting for that to go through, I want to debug and figure out what is wrong with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1.0.2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: After writing the original text, the solution did not work. Not sure what I am missing but here is what I’ve done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/oztmDY/7rYtV1OYGc+&quot; alt=&quot;TestFlight process&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it also seems that information from bullet point #2 is funky. I changed the app back to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1.0.1&lt;/code&gt; and changed build to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; and, as you can see, the app is still in the “Ready for Submit” state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to continue with this and, in mean time, I think I am just going to contact Apple Support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS. Yes, I did consult &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.apple.com/itunes-connect/developer/#/dev78d0a8f87&quot;&gt;View build status and metrics page&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.apple.com/itunes-connect/developer/#/dev3d6869aff&quot;&gt;app build statuses page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish Apple would provide more information on this “Ready to Submit” state because this does not really help me at this point in the process 🤕 Why? Because by clicking on this link:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/Dy4n8t/zHHV2KGmdt+&quot; alt=&quot;Click on this link&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will bring me to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/i0YRH9/sAGc3S3smm+&quot; alt=&quot;Ready to Submit definition from Apple&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which doesn’t really answer how to submit 🤕&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Daily Vibes is stuck somewhere here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d.pr/i/W9e1HV/LS8BkWOfsq+&quot; alt=&quot;Daily Vibes is stuck in one of these phases&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,
Alex&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be a quick post, mainly a reference to some resource I’ve been using to get familiar with iOS testing and refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refactoring is fun because I get to exercise my software engineering muscles. This is one of the reasons that I like Swift so much. I get to apply my software engineering knowledge on my own projects 👏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing on the whole is not difficult in iOS. However, when you add things like CoreData then it becomes a bit more chaotic to filter through.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Another CoreData Day</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/another-coredata-day"/>
   <updated>2018-01-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/Another-CoreData-day</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, today, I decided to implement the Sharing extension. Oh boy, did I not expect to lose all of the data but it was necessary. It turns out that if you want to, at a time in the future, to add things to your app, well then you may be in for some effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best resource, hands down was this = &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ales.musto/making-a-share-extension-that-accepts-text-and-urls-in-combination-with-coredata-swift-3-a0139c0f9800&quot;&gt;Making a Share Extension that accepts text and URLs in combination with CoreData Swift 3&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t want to or don’t have time to learn about Core Data then you can just jump to that website. Follow it. And it will just work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/f6uxtZ&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the resource I talked about&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way, you can add those things in the future. So just plan for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, noticed that some tutorials are suggesting to ship the app with things like subscription services and such to be turned on. Just turned on and not active. This way you can add it whenever you want it but you went through review already. Or maybe you just don’t have the time and want to follow good practices. That’s fine too =)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I also used the following resources before I found the one above. Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I am going to spend some time looking at this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully someone can find it useful when they are doing this process as well. Maybe I will record it because it is a bit tricky. We’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Apple TestFlight Registration Notes</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/apple-testflight-notes"/>
   <updated>2018-01-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/apple-testflight-notes</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/nauNKe&quot; alt=&quot;TestFlight image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I crossed off one of the things that I wanted to do since December. I recorded my experience and thought process of registering for &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/testflight/&quot;&gt;TestFlight&lt;/a&gt;. This means that I went from nothing to having an App on the Apple App Store’s TestFlight section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I wanted to start a podcast and I could not narrow down on the topic. So, I figured that I might as well record this. The reason being that if, after the process, the process is traight forward then I would not publish anything. It turns out that the process is not as straightforward as one would have wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/jU2lUI&quot; alt=&quot;Audio recording screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I have a screen recording and a podcast that are going to be out whenever I process them. Hopefully it can be used as a resource for future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/jEftff&quot; alt=&quot;Screenrecording screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, to keep things moving, here is the list of resources that I used today as part of this process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it I think. So, by using the links above and 1.5 hours of my time, I know how to deliver iOS apps for a TestFlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are wondering if Apple’s documents are up to date, then let me save you the uncertainty with a big no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep up for this episode somewhere on my social media channels. For the next episode (that I will be doing soon): How to publish an app into the store? Or something along these lines. I’m super excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,
Alex&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>2018 Goals: More Regular Writings</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/regular-writings"/>
   <updated>2018-01-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/regular-writings</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/5Nw3As&quot; alt=&quot;Target goals image from https://pixabay.com/en/arrow-target-range-bullseye-sport-2889040/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a few goals for 2017. Rather than having a year in a review post, I decided to narrow down my focus to software. At least two of  my goals related to software. I succeeded in achieving both of those goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;be-proactive&quot;&gt;Be Proactive&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first goal, was to be more proactive in my ideas. In other words, I wanted to stop dreaming about solutions and to take action on those ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-did-i-approach-this&quot;&gt;How did I approach this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, for starters, that meant that I had to get into the habit of writing down every new idea. Regardless of the idea and its feasibility. It did not matter what state I was in, where was I, or what I was doing. I wrote everything down and I dated it. Writing things down removes extra load from your beautiful brain and puts the ideas into a specific place. And guess what? You know exactly where that place is and you can reference it at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dating my ideas came as an after thought. Once my list began to grow and get out of hand, I realized that I needed some structure and cohesion. By now, dating new ideas is second nature by now and I quite enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;document-all-the-things&quot;&gt;Document All The Things&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other goal for 2017 was to be more deliberate in my software development process. I wanted to be more deliberate in the ways that I approach software engineering. At the end of the day, I want to practice what I preach. I began to document how I plan, brainstorm, document, and iterate on my ideas. There is much more than that, but this was a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-this-entail&quot;&gt;What did this entail?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/HlAf3W&quot; alt=&quot;indiehacker.com image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I am very much inspired by fellow indie developers, I began searching for strategies. I wanted to discover where everyone hangs out. I wanted to go there and hang out with them. I wanted to give back and participate. I wanted to learn from them. With them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not the successful and loud ones. Everyone. And I came to the conclusion that what they do is exactly what I want to do. They want to better their process and their product. How do they do that? By being “transparent” about what they do and how they do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/5433fS&quot; alt=&quot;wip.chat image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t dwell on the transparency word. What I mean by that is that there is a certain amount of magic in proclaiming a public goal and then working towards achieving that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Documentation plays a big part of this. How? Well, if I make a public goal and everyone sees that I am working towards achieving that goal then an interesting thing happens. First, you get motivated to keep working on that goal. Second, you get immediate feedback from the world. Which bring me to the third point. You need to respond to that feedback and have a conversation. Behind those cat avatars and pseudonyms, on the Internet, are real people with real opinions and thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/4IBKv2&quot; alt=&quot;Avatars Image from https://pixabay.com/en/networks-personal-users-3017398/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process of using social media requires you to actually USE it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, where is this rambling of mine taking me? Towards my goal for 2018 of course. I want to document things more in the open. I mean, I already do this work for myself so I might as well share it with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the process, I hope to share whatever I find useful with fellow developers and to better my communication skills through it. If you cannot tell from this article, I tend to ramble a lot. Two academic degrees will do that to you. I mean, that research article or lab report isn’t going to write itself 🙉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/njPGUq&quot; alt=&quot;Or maybe I should just start an ICO? Image from https://pixabay.com/en/bitcoin-currency-blockchain-2018-3047129/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this is why I resurfaced my blog and re-added my previous entries. This is my commitment to documenting all of the things. I hope these will be more frequent. At least for 2018. I hope that you will enjoy this adventure because I will.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Installing Yosemite on E8400</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/installing-yosemite-on-e8400"/>
   <updated>2014-12-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/Installing-Yosemite-on-E8400</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;First and foremost… I like experimenting with different OS environment just so I stay familiar. Besides having Windows, CentOS, and Ubuntu running on my computer, I decided to give OS X another try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer Hardware:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ark.intel.com/products/33910/Intel-Core2-Duo-Processor-E8400-6M-Cache-3_00-GHz-1333-MHz-FSB&quot;&gt;Intel Core 2 Duo E8400&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=2615&amp;amp;kw=GA-P31-DS3L&quot;&gt;Gigabyte GA-P31-DS3L Motherboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814500187&quot;&gt;Nvidia GTS450 Graphics card&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 gb DDR2 Ram (667 MHz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, my hardware is ‘old’ by today’s standards. However, I try to get the best bang for my buck without upgrading. I only upgrade my hardware when something fails. It has been working well so far. My computer is on 24/7/365 except for random reboots and power outages. I’ve had this PC on 24/7 since 2008. I’ve had it on 24/7/365 since 2010. I am on my second motherboard (lan failed on first one), second CPU cooler (by choice), and a 3rd GPU. This CPU is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not installed OS X after purchasing a new graphic card &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814500187&quot;&gt;Nvidia GTS450&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. I had an old 8600GTS before this graphic card. The prior graphic card had no problem with running OS X 10.6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to give the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tonymacx86.com/&quot;&gt;hackintosh project&lt;/a&gt; a shot. I installed &lt;a href=&quot;http://tonymacx86.blogspot.ca/2010/04/iboot-multibeast-install-mac-os-x-on.html&quot;&gt;OS X 10.6&lt;/a&gt; at first. However, I noticed that my GTS450 was not being recognized. I did perform several troubleshooting steps. After searching for a bit, I found out that GTS450 support improved as of 10.7. At this point, I was debating on whether or not to install 10.7 or to jump to 10.10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to jump to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tonymacx86.com/445-unibeast-install-os-x-yosemite-any-supported-intel-based-pc.html&quot;&gt;Yosemite 10.10&lt;/a&gt; after reading the tonymacx86 forums. A number of users reported successful bootings with Fermi graphic cards. I used my macbook to download the upgrade and make a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads.php?do=file&amp;amp;id=249&quot;&gt;bootable USB&lt;/a&gt;. The system did not boot until I added the following flags:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;GraphicsEnabler=Yes, PCIRootUID=1, npci=0x2000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find out what each of these flags does &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tonymacx86.com/basics/104536-troubleshooting-issuing-boot-flags.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. After the inital install everything booted smoothly. I then ran &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads.php?do=file&amp;amp;id=252&quot;&gt;MultiBeast&lt;/a&gt;. I followed the specifications for my motherboard and installed the appropriate drives. Everything worked after a restart. However, I noticed that my system experienced random freezes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There did not appear to be any pattern to the cause of the freeze. The freezing began by not responding to any key presses or mouse clicks. However, I was able to move the mouse across my dual screen setup. After some time, the mouse cursor finally disappeared from the display(s). The system then gives a black screen and instantaneously brings the Yosemite login screen. Upon entering my password and loading Yosemite, the bug report displayed a problem with my graphic card. I spent a few hours looking for a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than troubleshooting a graphic card that is not natively supported by Apple (yet? will it be?), I am leaning towards upgrading my graphic card. I had previous problems with the graphic card. It is not able to support my two monitors at the maximum resolutions. I am really pushing its performance when I am editing images. Therefore, I am leaning towards upgrading my graphic card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I am going to purchase a graphic card that brings my hardware closer to the Mac specifications outlined by Apple AND drives my two monitors easily (at max. resolution).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tonymacx86.com/&quot;&gt;this group of people&lt;/a&gt; has done a fantastic job in easing the installation of OS X on any Intel-based hardware. Their guides are phenomenal. The difference between installing OS X 10.6 and 10.10 is night and day. It used to take me hours (or days) to research, prepare, compile, and install - took me a few hours for 10.10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only do I have a working OS, but I also have a fully bootable USB that can be natively plugged into any Intel-based machine. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A different archival strategy for pictures on CentOS 7</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/a-different-archival-strategy-for-pictures"/>
   <updated>2014-10-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/A-different-archival-strategy-for-pictures</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I decided to learn about bash scripting in order to encrypt all of my pictures and movies before uploading them. More specifically, I wanted individual encryption and not an encryption of an entire archive of pictures and movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an exercise in improving my backups. I have a habit of not downloading an entire archive because the size of an archive is typically large. To solve this problem, I want to mimick my entire library by preserving the file structure on a server. However, I wanted to have all of my files encrypted prior to having them uploaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that by sampling a few files out of an uploaded directory will allow me to speed up my recovery as compared to downloading the entire archive. Therefore, I needed a way to encrypt and decrypt my files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals that I wanted to achieve for encryption:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;automated&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;password had to be entered as an argument&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cipher had to be chosen as an argument&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after encryption all of the file names had to remain original&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;all JPG files had to be encrypted individually&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;every encrypted file had to be saved into /enc/ folder with the original file name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals that I wanted to achieve for decryption:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;automated&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;password and cipher entered as arguments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;all decrypted files had to maintain its original file name&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;all JPG files decrypted individually&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;every decrypted file had to be saved into /dec/ folder with the original file name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Using wget in CentOS 6.5</title>
   <link href="https://getaclue.me/using-wget"/>
   <updated>2014-04-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getaclue.me/Using-wget</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;using-wget-in-centos-65&quot;&gt;Using wget in CentOS 6.5&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, everything that you need is here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we need to have somewhere to save the &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; that you would like to download. To do that, simply make a new place &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mkdir /some/path&lt;/code&gt; and then go there by using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cd /some/path&lt;/code&gt;. Good. Now, you have somewhere to store your stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is to download an entire website. That is, I want some website to be available for my offline usage. Everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wget --limit-rate=50k --no-clobber --convert-links --wait=5 --random-wait
-r -p -E -e robots=off -U Mozilla http://www.foo.bar
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, why did I use the settings that I used?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--limit-rate=50k&lt;/code&gt; to limit the download speed of each file to 50KB/s&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-- no-clobber&lt;/code&gt; so that I do not overwrite existing files. (multiple savings of the same file is prevented)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--convert-links&lt;/code&gt; to ensure that all of the downloaded links point locally and do not point to any external places&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--wait=5&lt;/code&gt; to wait 5 seconds between each new request for a new file&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--random-wait&lt;/code&gt; to try and reduce the load on the server. It &lt;strong&gt;needs&lt;/strong&gt; –wait attribute&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-r&lt;/code&gt; for recursive downloading of the entire website&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-p&lt;/code&gt; to download all of the necessary files to display the html page properly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-E&lt;/code&gt; for appending &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.html&lt;/code&gt; to files that have otherwise other extensions such as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;something.else?suchas25&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;something.else?suchas25.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-e robots=off&lt;/code&gt; to by pass possible robot exclusion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-U Mozilla&lt;/code&gt; to identify as a Mozilla client and not &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Wget/VERSION&lt;/code&gt; client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download the sourcecode (link used in March 2014) and place it in the newely created directory in the step above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://xchat.org/files/source/2.8/xchat-2.8.8.tar.bz2
http://xchat.org/files/source/2.8/xchat-2.8.8.tar.xz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unpack the archive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;tar -xzvf xchat-x.x.x.tar.xz
tar -xjvf xchat-x.x.x.tar.bz2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to the newely unpacked directory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd xchat-2.8.8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run the configuration script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;./configure
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compile the program:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;make
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, install the program:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
make install
&lt;/code&gt;
***&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problems-ive-encountered-while-setting-up&quot;&gt;Problems I’ve encountered while setting up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While trying to compile the source code, I’ve gotten the following error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;configure: error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution? We are missing the gcc, which can be installed via the development tools kit. In my case, I didn’t solely look for the gcc but I installed the entire pack because I knew I would be using the tools eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;yum groupinstall &quot;Development tools&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, this same command can be ran on Debian Base OS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;apt-get install build-essential
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, I did run all of this as root. If you are not root, place &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; in front of the commands that you have no direct access to and enter your password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Side note, system information: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;uname-a&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Linux localhost.localdomain 2.6.32-431.11.2.el6.x86_64

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;#Installing OpenVPN and Configuring for PrivateInternetAccess#
Go to /etc/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd /etc/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the correct repo, which you are probably missing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wget
 http://pkgs.repoforge.org/rpmforge-release/rpmforge-release-0.5.3-1.el6.rf.x86_64.rpm
rpm -Uvh rpmforge-release-0.5.3-1.el6.rf.x86_64.rpm
(U - Update, v - verbose, h - has)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install OpenVPN from the new repo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;yum install openvpn
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download correct preconfigured files from www.privateinternetaccess.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wget https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/openvpn/openvpn.zip
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a new directory, move the downloaded file into the directory, unzip the contents, and go into the directory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mv openvpn.zip ./openvpn
unzip openvpn.zip
cd openvpn
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test to see if everything is working properly. Be prepared to enter your self-generated password and username (and not the one provided for you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;openvpn Canada.ovpn
	OR
openvpn *.ovpn (* - any other location from the list)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ctrl+c&lt;/code&gt; to terminate the connection if everything is successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;optional&quot;&gt;Optional:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to run openvpn in the background, a useful utility is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;yum install screen
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, when you would want to initialize an instance, simple do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;screen openvpn *.ovpn
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and, now, the instance of openvpn can be run within the screen. Thus, we can safeuly press &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ctrl + a + d&lt;/code&gt; and the screen will disappear but the session will continue to be open. &lt;strong&gt;Super Useful&lt;/strong&gt;. Once you are ready to terminate the session, you can simply close your machine, or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;screen -ls
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This command will open all of the screen’s running instances. Simply find the one that is dedicated to the openvpn and then open the session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;screen -x &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once inside, simple close it and exit the screen instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ctrl + c
exit
	OR
ctrl + c
ctrl + d
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside: If you want, you can start the screen with a custom name. When you do this, it is much easier to find your specific open session if you have multiple screen sessions open. Simply do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;screen -S &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, I did run all of this as root. If you are not root, place &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; in front of the commands that you have no direct access to and enter your password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Side note, system information: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;uname-a&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Linux localhost.localdomain 2.6.32-431.11.2.el6.x86_64
