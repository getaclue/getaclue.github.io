      This will be a quick post, mainly a reference to some resource I‚Äôve been using to get familiar with iOS testing and refactoring. Refactoring is fun because I get to exercise my software engineering muscles. This is one of the reasons that I like Swift so much. I get to apply my software engineering knowledge on my own projects üëè Testing on the whole is not difficult in iOS. However, when you add things like CoreData then it becomes a bit more chaotic to filter through.

      So, today, I decided to implement the Sharing extension. Oh boy, did I not expect to lose all of the data but it was necessary. It turns out that if you want to, at a time in the future, to add things to your app, well then you may be in for some effort. The best resource, hands down was this = Making a Share Extension that accepts text and URLs in combination with CoreData Swift 3. If you don‚Äôt want to or don‚Äôt have time to learn about Core Data then you can just jump to that website. Follow it. And it will just work. This way, you can add those things in the future. So just plan for it. Also, noticed that some tutorials are suggesting to ship the app with things like subscription services and such to...

      Today, I crossed off one of the things that I wanted to do since December. I recorded my experience and thought process of registering for TestFlight. This means that I went from nothing to having an App on the Apple App Store‚Äôs TestFlight section. Why? Well, I wanted to start a podcast and I could not narrow down on the topic. So, I figured that I might as well record this. The reason being that if, after the process, the process is traight forward then I would not publish anything. It turns out that the process is not as straightforward as one would have wanted. So, I have a screen recording and a podcast that are going to be out whenever I process them. Hopefully it can be used as a resource for future. In the meantime, to keep things...

      I had a few goals for 2017. Rather than having a year in a review post, I decided to narrow down my focus to software. At least two of my goals related to software. I succeeded in achieving both of those goals. Be Proactive My first goal, was to be more proactive in my ideas. In other words, I wanted to stop dreaming about solutions and to take action on those ideas. How did I approach this? Well, for starters, that meant that I had to get into the habit of writing down every new idea. Regardless of the idea and its feasibility.
