        <p>So, today, I decided to implement the Sharing extension. Oh boy, did I not expect to lose all of the data but it was necessary. It turns out that if you want to, at a time in the future, to add things to your app, well then you may be in for some effort.</p>

<p>The best resource, hands down was this = <a href="https://medium.com/@ales.musto/making-a-share-extension-that-accepts-text-and-urls-in-combination-with-coredata-swift-3-a0139c0f9800">Making a Share Extension that accepts text and URLs in combination with CoreData Swift 3</a>. If you don‚Äôt want to or don‚Äôt have time to learn about Core Data then you can just jump to that website. Follow it. And it will just work.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/f6uxtZ" alt="Screenshot of the resource I talked about" /></p>

<p>This way, you can add those things in the future. So just plan for it.</p>

<p>Also, noticed that some tutorials are suggesting to ship the app with things like subscription services and such to be turned on. Just turned on and not active. This way you can add it whenever you want it but you went through review already. Or maybe you just don‚Äôt have the time and want to follow good practices. That‚Äôs fine too =)</p>

<p>So, I also used the following resources before I found the one above. Here they are:</p>

  <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreservices/kuttypeurl">kUTTypeURL</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Anyways, I am going to spend some time looking at this:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/w1h7OB" alt="Screenshot of homepage for Apple's App Extension Keys Dictionary Thing" /></p>

<p>Hopefully someone can find it useful when they are doing this process as well. Maybe I will record it because it is a bit tricky. We‚Äôll see.</p>

<p>Today, I crossed off one of the things that I wanted to do since December. I recorded my experience and thought process of registering for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/testflight/">TestFlight</a>. This means that I went from nothing to having an App on the Apple App Store‚Äôs TestFlight section.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Well, I wanted to start a podcast and I could not narrow down on the topic. So, I figured that I might as well record this. The reason being that if, after the process, the process is traight forward then I would not publish anything. It turns out that the process is not as straightforward as one would have wanted.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/jU2lUI" alt="Audio recording screenshot" /></p>

<p>So, I have a screen recording and a podcast that are going to be out whenever I process them. Hopefully it can be used as a resource for future.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/jEftff" alt="Screenrecording screenshot" /></p>

<p>In the meantime, to keep things moving, here is the list of resources that I used today as part of this process:</p>

</ul>

<p>That‚Äôs it I think. So, by using the links above and 1.5 hours of my time, I know how to deliver iOS apps for a TestFlight.</p>

<p>If you are wondering if Apple‚Äôs documents are up to date, then let me save you the uncertainty with a big no.</p>

<p>Keep up for this episode somewhere on my social media channels. For the next episode (that I will be doing soon): How to publish an app into the store? Or something along these lines. I‚Äôm super excited.</p>

<p>Cheers,
Alex</p>

      <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p><img src="https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/5Nw3As" alt="Target goals image from https://pixabay.com/en/arrow-target-range-bullseye-sport-2889040/" /></p>

<p>I had a few goals for 2017. Rather than having a year in a review post, I decided to narrow down my focus to software. At least two of  my goals related to software. I succeeded in achieving both of those goals.</p>

<h1 id="be-proactive">Be Proactive</h1>
<p>My first goal, was to be more proactive in my ideas. In other words, I wanted to stop dreaming about solutions and to take action on those ideas.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-i-approach-this">How did I approach this?</h2>
<p>Well, for starters, that meant that I had to get into the habit of writing down every new idea. Regardless of the idea and its feasibility. It did not matter what state I was in, where was I, or what I was doing. I wrote everything down and I dated it. Writing things down removes extra load from your beautiful brain and puts the ideas into a specific place. And guess what? You know exactly where that place is and you can reference it at any time.</p>

<p>Dating my ideas came as an after thought. Once my list began to grow and get out of hand, I realized that I needed some structure and cohesion. By now, dating new ideas is second nature by now and I quite enjoy it.</p>

<h1 id="document-all-the-things">Document All The Things</h1>
<p>The other goal for 2017 was to be more deliberate in my software development process. I wanted to be more deliberate in the ways that I approach software engineering. At the end of the day, I want to practice what I preach. I began to document how I plan, brainstorm, document, and iterate on my ideas. There is much more than that, but this was a good start.</p>

<h2 id="what-did-this-entail">What did this entail?</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/HlAf3W" alt="indiehacker.com image" /></p>

<p>Since I am very much inspired by fellow indie developers, I began searching for strategies. I wanted to discover where everyone hangs out. I wanted to go there and hang out with them. I wanted to give back and participate. I wanted to learn from them. With them.</p>

<p>Not the successful and loud ones. Everyone. And I came to the conclusion that what they do is exactly what I want to do. They want to better their process and their product. How do they do that? By being ‚Äútransparent‚Äù about what they do and how they do it.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/5433fS" alt="wip.chat image" /></p>

<p>Don‚Äôt dwell on the transparency word. What I mean by that is that there is a certain amount of magic in proclaiming a public goal and then working towards achieving that goal.</p>

<p>Documentation plays a big part of this. How? Well, if I make a public goal and everyone sees that I am working towards achieving that goal then an interesting thing happens. First, you get motivated to keep working on that goal. Second, you get immediate feedback from the world. Which bring me to the third point. You need to respond to that feedback and have a conversation. Behind those cat avatars and pseudonyms, on the Internet, are real people with real opinions and thoughts.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/4IBKv2" alt="Avatars Image from https://pixabay.com/en/networks-personal-users-3017398/" /></p>

<p>This process of using social media requires you to actually USE it.</p>

<p>So, where is this rambling of mine taking me? Towards my goal for 2018 of course. I want to document things more in the open. I mean, I already do this work for myself so I might as well share it with you.</p>

<p>In the process, I hope to share whatever I find useful with fellow developers and to better my communication skills through it. If you cannot tell from this article, I tend to ramble a lot. Two academic degrees will do that to you. I mean, that research article or lab report isn‚Äôt going to write itself üôâ</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-pro.dprcdn.net/files/acc_603419/njPGUq" alt="Or maybe I should just start an ICO? Image from https://pixabay.com/en/bitcoin-currency-blockchain-2018-3047129/" /></p>

<p>So, this is why I resurfaced my blog and re-added my previous entries. This is my commitment to documenting all of the things. I hope these will be more frequent. At least for 2018. I hope that you will enjoy this adventure because I will.</p>

        <p>First and foremost‚Ä¶ I like experimenting with different OS environment just so I stay familiar. Besides having Windows, CentOS, and Ubuntu running on my computer, I decided to give OS X another try.</p>

<p>Computer Hardware:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/33910/Intel-Core2-Duo-Processor-E8400-6M-Cache-3_00-GHz-1333-MHz-FSB">Intel Core 2 Duo E8400</a></li>
  <li><a href="www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=2615&amp;kw=GA-P31-DS3L">Gigabyte GA-P31-DS3L Motherboard</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814500187">Nvidia GTS450 Graphics card</a></li>
  <li>4 gb DDR2 Ram (667 MHz)</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, my hardware is ‚Äòold‚Äô by today‚Äôs standards. However, I try to get the best bang for my buck without upgrading. I only upgrade my hardware when something fails. It has been working well so far. My computer is on 24/7/365 except for random reboots and power outages. I‚Äôve had this PC on 24/7 since 2008. I‚Äôve had it on 24/7/365 since 2010. I am on my second motherboard (lan failed on first one), second CPU cooler (by choice), and a 3rd GPU. This CPU is amazing.</p>

<p>I have not installed OS X after purchasing a new graphic card <a href="http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814500187">Nvidia GTS450</a> earlier this year. I had an old 8600GTS before this graphic card. The prior graphic card had no problem with running OS X 10.6.</p>

<p>I decided to give the <a href="http://tonymacx86.com/">hackintosh project</a> a shot. I installed <a href="http://tonymacx86.blogspot.ca/2010/04/iboot-multibeast-install-mac-os-x-on.html">OS X 10.6</a> at first. However, I noticed that my GTS450 was not being recognized. I did perform several troubleshooting steps. After searching for a bit, I found out that GTS450 support improved as of 10.7. At this point, I was debating on whether or not to install 10.7 or to jump to 10.10.</p>

<p>I decided to jump to <a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/445-unibeast-install-os-x-yosemite-any-supported-intel-based-pc.html">Yosemite 10.10</a> after reading the tonymacx86 forums. A number of users reported successful bootings with Fermi graphic cards. I used my macbook to download the upgrade and make a <a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads.php?do=file&amp;id=249">bootable USB</a>. The system did not boot until I added the following flags:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>GraphicsEnabler=Yes, PCIRootUID=1, npci=0x2000
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can find out what each of these flags does <a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/basics/104536-troubleshooting-issuing-boot-flags.html">here</a>. After the inital install everything booted smoothly. I then ran <a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads.php?do=file&amp;id=252">MultiBeast</a>. I followed the specifications for my motherboard and installed the appropriate drives. Everything worked after a restart. However, I noticed that my system experienced random freezes.</p>

<p>There did not appear to be any pattern to the cause of the freeze. The freezing began by not responding to any key presses or mouse clicks. However, I was able to move the mouse across my dual screen setup. After some time, the mouse cursor finally disappeared from the display(s). The system then gives a black screen and instantaneously brings the Yosemite login screen. Upon entering my password and loading Yosemite, the bug report displayed a problem with my graphic card. I spent a few hours looking for a solution.</p>

<p>Rather than troubleshooting a graphic card that is not natively supported by Apple (yet? will it be?), I am leaning towards upgrading my graphic card. I had previous problems with the graphic card. It is not able to support my two monitors at the maximum resolutions. I am really pushing its performance when I am editing images. Therefore, I am leaning towards upgrading my graphic card.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I am going to purchase a graphic card that brings my hardware closer to the Mac specifications outlined by Apple AND drives my two monitors easily (at max. resolution).</p>

<p>In conclusion, <a href="http://tonymacx86.com/">this group of people</a> has done a fantastic job in easing the installation of OS X on any Intel-based hardware. Their guides are phenomenal. The difference between installing OS X 10.6 and 10.10 is night and day. It used to take me hours (or days) to research, prepare, compile, and install - took me a few hours for 10.10.</p>

<p>Not only do I have a working OS, but I also have a fully bootable USB that can be natively plugged into any Intel-based machine. Amazing.</p>
