about_author_snippet: >
  I am a software engineering student at the University of Ottawa. At the time of writing, my interests are in the area of web development. I like the idea of having the user use your tool regardless of the device and operating system. I believe that the user experience for your tool should be identical (or as close as it can be) on all platforms and devices.
